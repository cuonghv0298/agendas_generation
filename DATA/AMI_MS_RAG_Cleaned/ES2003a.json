    "transcript": "Okay, well I think we're ready to begin. Right, my name's Adam Duguid, we're here because of real reaction, um, we have in the group Um, yeah, go for it mate. N_ E_ Z_. Ebenezer. And your role is? You're the Marketing Expert, okay. Next we have? T_ R_ I_ K_. And your role in this is? Industrial Designer. And, lastly we have? And you're going to be the User Interface, is it? Designer. Okay. Right. This is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. Um, we already got n through opening, and partially through acquaintance. So, the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, as you probably all know. The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. Course, we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that, but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design. Um, there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway, so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart. This is how today seems to be going to work. We're gonna have the three kay phases, as you've probably already been told, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. Um First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. Second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Of course, you've all got the similar emails, I believe, right. What can I say? Ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Brilliantly done. Thank you. Tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry? Oh, um, you can clip them to your belt. You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well. Yep, the, it's just across there, that's it. Yep. Yeah. It'll follow you if you You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now, I wouldn't worry too much. Should have good range. Excellent, thank you very much. Dave, if you'd like to uh have a dash. Cheers. Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now. Also not quite as feared as your average tiger, but uh cats are one of my favourite animals, they're very independent, they're snotty as hell at the best of times, and uh, what can you say, you got to love those qualities in an animal. Right. I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it, so, on to it. Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit. That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware, and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. Yep. Well, fifty million, and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one, then, awful lot need to be sold. Okay. Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project. So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls. Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? Okay. Okay, yeah, tha that's true, with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah. But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion. Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of Okay, that sounds like a a good strong idea. Um Any takes on this? Okay. Okay. Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before, yeah. Okay, well we're beginning to run out of time now, so, we've got a couple of ideas, we can we'll have to work fast, um, alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, um, how the user interface might work, that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it, you have to have a lot of response back, or at least some kind. Um And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out what the user wants, yes. Um, right. Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage, anything they think that might have been missed so far? I I don't see why not, almost everybody is probably used to a console by now, and all of them incorporate small keypads on them, in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well, so it's probably an interface that most people are used to. Um and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well. Okay. So, small, stylish, and something that's just a little different. Okay. That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily. I would I would have hoped so anyway. Um, right. I'd say we finish this one up, we get started, I'll get in, I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done, and I'll get that out to everybody. Yeah? Okay. Um, as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here, um unless we get told otherwise, and just take the laptops with us.\nOh, Ebenezer Ademesoye. Would you like me to spell that? S Um, N_E_Z_ E_R_. I'm the Marketing Expert. Sure. Whiteboard. 'Kay. S okay. I will make this quick, since we don't have much time. Um. 'Kay, so it's not the best picture in the world. Here we have an elephant. First point, begins with an E_, same like Ebenezer. Also, elephants have a very good memory, much like myself, and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant. So elephants are big, strong and gentle, and they have great memories, and they begin with the letter E_, just like Ebenezer. Thank you. Oh. Oh oh I think you ga The little The the Oh that's good, we can clip them on. Okay. Yeah, there was this microphone as well that you Just um somewhere I think so. Yeah. There you go. Oh, that was profiting, that was an amount, so that's the amount made, okay. Yeah. Oh. 'Kay Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, um keypad, for playing games. So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television. They they've recently brought out this new remote control, for people to set their favourite channels, or um to record things. Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and slide another bar to say what time it ends, you know that's Yeah, it's it's taken out the Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control. I think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot. Uh, you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television, so you need buttons to change the television angle, the camera angles and stuff like that. Yeah. What the user wants uh. Okay. Oh. Okay,. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. So..\nTarik Rahman. T_A_R_I_K_. Industrial Designer.. Do we take them off? Oh right, okay. Ah-ha. Now where do I put the Is this supposed to be clipped as well? Uh, destroying your elephant here. Uh, here we have a tiger. Uh I've always loved tigers. They're just they're big, they're biggest cats, uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat, just 'cause it was looks the best, the stripes, orange. My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid. And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild. So uh that's why I like them. Didn't say an anything about me really but Mm. 'Kay. Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff, do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? Like uh control pads, you know of games, but or is that a bit ridiculous? Yeah..\nUh, Dave Cochrane. User Interface Defin Designer, yes. Um Um, the monkey, um. The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey. Um, monkeys have attitude. Which I think is a good thing. And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting. Um, so I like monkeys. And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most. Well, one thing I'm aware of is, th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs, you can programme in macros, and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one, five in one, whatevers, but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control, to a much greater extent, and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel, get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound, for instance. Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket. Absolutely prohibitive, yeah. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion. Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros. For instance, um let's say oh oh um, or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. But of course, uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall,. A curve, mm-hmm. Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form, uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway.\n@highlight\nmy name's Adam Duguid , Ebenezer Ademesoye .\n@highlight\nI'm the Marketing Expert .\n@highlight\nTarik Rahman .\n@highlight\nT_A_R_I_K_ .\n@highlight\nUh , Dave Cochrane .\n@highlight\nAnd you're going to be the User Interface , This is the agenda for today's meeting .\n@highlight\nAs you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing .\n@highlight\nthe reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly .\n@highlight\nWe're gonna have the three kay phases , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design .\n@highlight\nUm First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design .\n@highlight\nSecond seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far .\n@highlight\nEbenezer , you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ?\n@highlight\nHere we have an elephant .\n@highlight\nTarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?\n@highlight\nUh , here we have a tiger .\n@highlight\nUh Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash .\n@highlight\nUm Um , the monkey , um .\n@highlight\nbut uh cats are one of my favourite animals , Project finance .\n@highlight\nAs you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit .\n@highlight\nand we're hoping to sell them for twenty five .\n@highlight\nIf we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .\n@highlight\nthat was profiting , Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?\n@highlight\none thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design .\n@highlight\nAnd therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .\n@highlight\nwith the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our Absolutely prohibitive , But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .\n@highlight\nI mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros .\n@highlight\nWould the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , I've seen the bar-code design before , Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games .\n@highlight\nI think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .\n@highlight\nUh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ?\n@highlight\nLike uh control pads , you know of games , and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .\n@highlight\nMm-hmm .\n@highlight\nThe other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , um , how the user interface might work , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand .\n@highlight\nBut of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , .\n@highlight\nsmall , stylish , and something that's just a little different .\n@highlight\nSomething sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody .",

Also, engineer will have to wait for requirements as the use of the remote will determine which material. For example, a nice soft material may be great for attracting a certain audience, but if the remote is to be used for long periods of time, daily, then the soft material may simply wear away quicker. A more sturdy remote would be more appropriate. However, if the remote is to be used as conventional remotes are used, then the sturdyness is nnecessary.

The idea of a LCD and joystick was instead chosen based on users previous use of mobile phones. This small number of buttons should allow for a wide range of designs to allow the product to stand out. The concept of losing the RC was pursued and it was decided to include a design that allows audio and visual localization. This would be activated by a device placed on the side of the TV or if a deal with a manufacturing company is met then inside the TV .\nRemote Control requirements are as follows\nMonochrome LCD large enough to comfortably show enough information for navigation.\nDual-purpose joystick for either navigating LCD display or up-down function for volume and left-right for channel switching.\nPower button in addition to 2 other buttons. One to start LCD navigation and another to confirm selection.\nSmall (possibly battery operated) transmitter for locating the RC if lost. Transmitter to be secured somewhere to be chosen by user\nSpeaker and bright LED to be used to allow location when transmitter is used.\nDesign to be in keeping with ergonomics but still unique and including company logo"

                "content": "Real Reaction – updating the Remote Control\nIt is the decision of Real Reactions to enter the world of TV remote controls. Initially the market is replacement RC units with the possibility of supplying to TV manufacturers.\nWith the market today, Real Reaction will have to produce something that stands out in the concept of remote controls. The aim is to make use of consumers familiarity with mobile phones. The use of a LCD panel for navigation purposes connected with a joystick makes use of peoples knowledge and muscle memory to control the TV. The secondary goal of this venture was to create a remote control that was able to aid in locating itself in the event of being lost. This was envisaged by use of a small transmitter attached to a large unit such as the TV so that the transmitter can not be lost.\nInitial design decisions were the use of the LCD in conjunction with a joystick to minimize the interface. The use of a speaker and transmitter to aid locating the remote control. The limited interface allows a more unusual form to be investigated to help the unit stand out from the competition.\nThese ideas were followed through the second meeting in which it was decided that an advanced chip and LCD were to be used in keeping with the minimal interface. It was also pointed out that a keypad could be required but the decision was the LCD negated this requirement. It was also decided that a single unit could then be used in various countries as the chip could handle multi language support.\nCosts meant that in the final meeting the use of a rubber skin for feel appeal would have to be removed as would a double curve design. The concept of locating the unit after losing it would also have to be shelved for this model to bring it under costs. What makes the unit unique is potentially now lost but further analysis is required."
