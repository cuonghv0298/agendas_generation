Do you vote uh Christine? Do you also vote? Well, we can very easily. I So it will have five point five average. Mm. It's four. Yeah. D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not? Huh? No. Okay. Yeah. For twenty five. Yeah. I give a seven, I think. 'Kay. Yeah, we can we can put a seven here. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we hope. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's cool. I think we can put a six here. So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely, or Yeah. Yeah the only problem there might be which know, i if it's very sensitive, they will, I don't know Yeah, okay. Mm. Six, yeah, for me. Yeah. Twenty. Thirty. Thir Okay. Yeah, the top Mm. So will become eight soon? Yeah, well it's a bit biased. Okay. Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped, uh wireless phones not mobile ones, wireless for the house, uh quite big also, and they were selling something like a hundred Euros, two hundred Euros. Just a just a phone, wireless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's much more complex, but Okay. Congratulations to the team. Uh very well, we worked together fantastically. So what does the management say? What does the management say? Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm.\nMm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four. Evaluation. Okay. So you can go. We can go through. So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings. So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points. We we talked about before. So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, and robust, uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points. Okay. So I go through all the uh all the points here, and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point, two point or seven point. Okay? And after we ha we have an an average, and uh we see. The okay? Uh so uh fancy look and feel, what do you think? F between o one and seven. Yeah. Seven is the Mm-hmm. sorry. eh? No, I just want to see something Mm-hmm. Uh I think uh and need to as well. Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh. Um. Yeah. Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm. Oh sorry. Six Uh s you can how much what? Oh yes I mm I dunno mm, I think six, it's a good uh Yeah. Wa can. Okay. I sorry. Okay. So after, the technological aspect? So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel. Uh. No. Four. We can put four? Everyone is okay or four poin Four. Okay. Very easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? Mm, six for me also. Six point five. Okay. Is it fashion? Seven? Yeah it's fashion, because it's a fruit, and we say that the yeah, seven. Uh easy to find in a room? Yeah? We have the lightning, or The lighting. Yeah. Seven? Is it is it robust? Everybody is okay, six. Yeah. Okay. S now um so. Thirteen uh, twenty, twenty six point five, uh seven, thirty two, thirty six. That's that's okay? Six. Good. Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better, and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product, I think. We have a good price and uh. Good. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay.\nHi. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I will give a a five. Five. A four also, because, except for the wheel, we don't have so much innovation. The rubber is Uh a four. I I Yeah. Six. Six. Six six six point five. Yeah, seven. Easy to find. I lost my banana. Uh. Six. Yeah, okay. Uh f yeah, it's ru it's rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Six or five. Five. Six. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare. Start to eat banana. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fruits.\nOkay. Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype. It really looks like a banana. It is a banana. Mm. Okay. Hi. So we are here for the detailed design meeting. So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting. Then uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual. We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work. And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product. Then we will uh evaluate the product. And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not. So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say uh to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy, and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera. And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. So which is uh good, because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros. So for the financial aspect it's okay, we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if, and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert. Yeah. You have a presentation? Participant four, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe you can presen okay. Maybe hold it. So I think it's uh very uh very nice. What do you think? Yeah. So it's between one and seven? Seven is the highest uh? I will give a six. Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah. No problem. So this is your One is most. Well, we can choose what we want. Okay, let's say that seven is the best. Okay. So so do note the grade we have five, six for me, five. And what what's your choice? How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect? How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire? Five point five average. Okay. Well, does it Okay, techne technological aspect. Yeah, we have the wheel. We also have the rubber material, which make it uh like new also. I think I would give a five. Four? Okay. No. So what's your uh grade? Four? So we have four, four f and five? Yeah, four. Four, yeah, let's put four. Doesn't it Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I would give a I would give a seven as well. It's very easy to use. So six point five. Okay. Oh yeah, its its f its fruit fruit shape. I would say seven. And is very very nice design. Yeah. Seven, okay. I think you can't miss it. Okay. Yeah, we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow. It's okay. I think it's very easy to I would say seven. It's hard to miss it. Yeah, it's rubber, made of rubber, I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control. Yeah. But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material. So maybe we can put a six. Six is okay? Yeah. Tadada. We have to sum up everything. Six is a good Yeah, the be. Okay, so six is a So it's a good evaluation, I think. It's very promising. Huh. So this prototype is quite nice. Yeah. Okay. So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive, I think. I think the Yeah. So, I think, we can summarise. So we have seen the prototype. It's very nice according to the work of our two designer. The the the financial aspect were okay. We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well. So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting. So the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is okay, so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party. I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff. Okay so congratulation. Nice product. Yeah. I think it was a good collaboration uh. Aspect. Sorry? I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well. All it depends on who watch this meeting. We don't know.

We replace the channel up down button with a wheel. The wheel can be pushed down for channel recall(?)\nA plastic opening for the channel numbers is unnecessary and cubersome. It is also prone to breakage. It suffices for digits to  be well separated from the rest of the buttons."

This aspect is twice as important as the second aspect. \n\t- The second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. In turn, this aspect is twice as important as the next aspect. \n\t- The third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy-to-use. \n \nTrends\nFashion watchers in Paris and Milan have detected the following trends: \n\t- This year, fruit & vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths, shoes, and furniture.\n\t- Also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expected to be spongy.\nConclusion\nChoose a fruit or a vegetable to design the remote control?\nWhat material can we use to make the remote control spongy?"
