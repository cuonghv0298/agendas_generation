    "transcript": "I'm proud of it. Uh-huh. How how much do we have, forty minutes? Yeah. Okay, so. Presentation. Okay. Okay. So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. Um Yeah. Um Yeah. Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again. So now we we have the okay, so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. Um well, everything else is probably user interface, so. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, it has, yeah. Yeah, well, but i since it's made of rubber anyway. I I think it's it's uh Yeah. Mm. Hmm. It's on the side. Uh no, we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials. Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options. Mm. Mm. Yeah, it's hidden in there somewhere. Cool. We ran out of resources here, so. You can have a look. Yeah, see the budget. I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. So? Yes. Okay. But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger. But then yeah. Yeah. So bu it's it's not a huge problem, because i i it is operatable. Right. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, so it opens on the side. So Yeah yeah yeah, I mean yeah. So you guys can decide wh whether Oops. Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah. Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two, it might interfere with the I_R_ channel. Okay. Right. Okay. No, we have a locator. Yeah. Yeah. Intuitive, completely intuitive. Intuitive. And uh even the scroll, it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it. Yeah. So l Yeah, okay. I'm gonna give a seven in everything, so. Mm.. Yeah. Yeah, unless you are a all the time sitting. Yeah. Yeah, I I think it is ergonomic. Mm yeah. And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything, so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway. Absolutely. So it has voice control. Yep. Anyway it ha yeah, it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen. Yeah, but they've been brought together in a remote. Yeah. Absolutely. The carrot banana remote. I think that's a. Yeah. There are how many sixes? One, two, three. Three. And one five. Okay, twenty eight, thirty eight, fo forty six. Forty six and five, fifty one. Fifty one divided by Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit. Mm. Advanced, yeah. Yep. Mm anything uh I think which is not more. Yeah. Mm. No uh we we have uh yeah. Mm no. We don't have we're not using any of that. Huh? Wh wh what is the limit? Uh. Mm I don't think so, no. No it says what what is the kind of interface, if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display, so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have. Wh wh what's our criteria? Uh okay. Uh it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello. Mm and the locator also goes away. A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Uh I mean uh um yeah. Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button. No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing. That comes with the L_C_D_? Oh so so the the this is. So we're adding costs for right, okay uh I mean I think this is good. Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. On the side. Mm uh it sounds good actually, yeah.. We have, yeah. Not really, no. Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display. We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons. Um yeah. Yeah. But we lose the locator. So instead of speaker,. 'Kay. I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. Um we kap kept a adding things randomly. So, had we known Yeah, that or not, yeah. Yeah. So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented. Mm. Yeah, mm. Yeah yeah yeah, that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I guess it was a fairly small group, so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I thought that was good though, because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah. Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute. We certainly are, mm. Yeah. Yeah, same here. Mm uh no. I don't think so. Was there a questionnaire already sent?\nOkay. This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. And again I'll take minutes. The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently. Um then then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against. Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through. So we've got forty minutes. S 'Cause we missed out. So it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five, so we've got until four fifteen. Is that right? Yeah, until about four fifteen. So yeah. Go for it. Do you want Yes. Dual use, perfect. Dual use, perfect. Does it vibrate when you press the buttons? Sorry, sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wow. And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that Mm-hmm. Yeah. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Six seven eight nine. I like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you. But if you hold it in, if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in? no. Mm-hmm, very good. And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours. Mm-hmm. Very good, let's have a look. Test it out. Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour, I guess. Very good. Okay, so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues, but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow. We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way. Wales, for example. Marketing Expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right? Mm dots, never mind. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, just prepare one now. I reckon it Yeah. Seven, yeah, it's terribly sexy. Yeah. Ah, okay. Excellent. Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah, I'll take a note, it's fine. Yeah. I think it does. Alright. But that's gonna be a problem, 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Six. Yeah, I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed, so in in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good, but we might want to flag it for management, they want might want to um They Mm-hmm. Yeah. The length is gonna be difficu Mm. No, we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. I really like the way you have it, but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to. So Might be But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon. Five? Yeah. I'm happy with five? Yeah. Yep. But otherwise it's superb. Six. Yeah. Well we've banned them from Yeah. Yeah, it's varied. Yeah. Six? Voice control have seven. Ah, that's the second one. So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide. G_ technologically innovative. But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new. Yeah. All of the components have been used in other things before. But do yeah, yeah. Yeah. What do you reckon, five, six? Yeah. Space remote. Put fashion in electronics. Very good. Yeah, one. Or a seven. Fifty one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Six point point about six point five. Close enough. Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it. That's all you've got at the moment, or did you have anything more? That's it? Alright. So, finance. And we'll see if we can unscrew this first. Sorry, this is I'm just um Beautiful. Not anymore. Computer no signal? Adjusting. There we go. Okay, so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost. More or less. Um I started filling it in, but of course these are provisional, so we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right? One simple battery. No kinetic energy, no solar. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it. Case material we said rubber. I don't know what special colour means. It could be Rub rubber comes coloured, it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different. Yeah, let's leave it as zero, 'cause it's easy. We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton, and then we've Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no? S for the muting. Yeah. And button supplements. No. No? But the the spinning wheel's not there. I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display? I think the pushbutton oh. I don't know if that's one Yeah. That seems unlikely. Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Our budget's twelve point five. Yeah, so that has implications though for the. For the locator. Yeah. Yeah. What else does it need? Yeah, 'cause the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated then just a beeping thing. Yeah, okay, so we Uh-huh. Right, so we need one fifty off. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. We could do Yeah. You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute. That's with the L_C_ We decided, 'cause it's not on our list. The scroll wheel is on the side. We're point three over at the moment. It's nothing n Yeah, I have Yeah. Rather than having three different things that people have to do. There we go. Oh look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses. Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour. So that's alright. We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour, if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it, yeah. Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright then. We're gonna have a beep. Yeah. Yeah. Tha. 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh. Yeah, I know I know, my pen vibrates. But only for a very short time. Um okay. So looks like we've designed a banana. Well done, team. Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting, so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product. Feedback? Ideas? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting, that that worked in terms of. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Banana. Mm-hmm, the whiteboard digital pens. We like the pens. Yeah, you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office. They great? Do you think they'd notice if one went? Oh okay. Yep. Shh. Yep. But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint, 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there, yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's alright, that always irritates me anyway, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well. I have no stake in it. You have to say that, 'cause I'm taking the notes. I'll leave the room and you can have another go. Better than that than the banana. I think it worked quite well. Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit? Yeah.. New ideas found. Not quite sure what about. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. Banana remote. Yeah. Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control. Flip. Vibrate. And uh yeah. Nothing that you really want. True. Yeah. Okay. So, costs are within budget, well within budget, including a little what have we got? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. Um we've evaluated the project. You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents file? It's in there already. And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. Were there any was there anything that you found difficult, or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope? Yeah. Okay then. Um I think we're still well within our time. We've got about five minutes left, but if we've finished, then we've finished. We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time. So I would say that's the end of that meeting. Thank you, team. It was very productive day and Mm uh no. Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. I don't know if it's already sent or not. Um presumably I have to I don't see why you can't stay here, really. Did I save this one? Production costs. It was supposed to be pink. But it was blue on the board.\nYeah. Yeah, about four fifteen, yeah. So, you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things, like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well, but it's it's just an a approximation. Uh yeah. Rubber. Yeah,. Um it could be made a bit smaller, and and of course it would be and yeah, but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder, so we said the back side round, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's spongy as well. So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things. So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one. So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here. Yeah. And then, well this is on off button. It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red, so it's it's kind of user friendly. And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one. And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next. The volume is is scrolling. On the side, this one. Yeah you just do it like this. And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. See? So the volume is you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, okay, there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose. You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen, you just push the cen mm the middle button. A mute button. Well, we'll have this on the screen, on the display. Well, but the but the mute yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? Okay, yeah, okay. Yeah. And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface. Yeah. And we do have the logo on it as well. So I think it Yeah. Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website. In the actual one. Yeah. So if you have questions. Yeah. Yeah, the yeah, it's definitely attractive. Oh, the locatable thing we actually forgot. Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now? It will be red, too. S seven was th the maximum, yeah? I I go for seven. I would think yes, yeah. Yeah, so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. Yeah. But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway, so they just Yeah. Yeah, because I mean anyway, right-handed people would be able to scroll with it, so i if the majority are right-handed, it's uh Or maybe six, because it's just one one i one among the issues, I mean. Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah, but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah. So it won't be a problem, it will be and it will be it won't be heavy. Yeah well yeah, but it's it's a bit long. It's a little bit long. Well, I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah. S uh slightly smaller. Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that. Mm that you stick on T_V_. Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included, so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds, so yeah. Yep. Yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's Yeah. Yeah. Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway, yeah? See. Yeah, so it's kinda Yeah. Yeah, it does have yeah. Technologi well Yeah. Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well, which is yeah, it's kind of new. But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new. Six. I mean how how far can you go with a remote control, really? It still has to do what i what it has to do. Yeah, isn't it fashionable? Yeah, sure. It's the maximum fashion. Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days, so. So I think we've done very well, but What's the assessment? The average is about six and something. A little bit over six. No, wait, a little bit under six. No, wait. Oh, three sixes, okay, yeah. Four sevens. Six point something, yeah. Six point five, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, yes. Rubber. I think something coloured, yeah, probably. So I think this is probably special co no? Yeah. Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it, yeah yeah, okay. Yeah. We have pushbuttons, scro we have scroll wheel as well. S yeah, yeah, we had, for muting, yeah. And we have L_C_ display and yeah. Um Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah. Okay, let's yeah. We have to count all of them, or yeah. But it was very no innovative innovativeness. Well um yeah. Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. This would be Yeah, yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah, then then we would be in the b budget. Yeah b no no, you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing. Mm-hmm. But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well. If you Mm. So Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well we're going to have a beeping thing. But yeah, it's it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep, so we still have the locate. Which colour, the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well. It can come in the same colour as the the case. Yeah mm, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the m the means were very very good, the means we used. And the pens. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah. But yeah, but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was I was satisfied with with the leadership, yeah. Mm-hmm. And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely, yeah. To express them mm mm no. Well it's it's it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really, all this flipping open thing and Yeah, neither neither do I, but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this, actually, so. Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one. Patent patent patent. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. And my main difficulty was the the time pressure. Otherwise it's it's all fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you. You can make some animals. Oh, you don't like anim It doesn't? Smells quite nice. Smells very sweet. I made your animal for you. Yeah, that's the one\nIt does look very cool. And then do we get to make a remote control? Yeah. Yeah. You think bananas are a safe thing to use? It's a bit um phallic. Oh, your remote control? Oh that's just bad. Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller? Yeah. It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable. I wasn't very keen on that, but yeah. So where's the volume? Ah, you did get that in then, mm-hmm. Oh okay,. Cool. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. Yeah. On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute. Yeah, but it's a scroll and click, isn't it? Okay, cool. So that that solves the whole mute issue.. Yeah.. Yeah, oh, we hold the remote. Oh, but it it does feel all cold and slimy. I hate Play-Do, it's just minging. But yeah, uh that's cool, cool. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wales. Mm. Cool, okay. Right, okay. Fabulous, yeah. Okay, cool. So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale, so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again. Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah, we did manage to do that, or oh no, we really forgot about that. Okay? Cool, so these are what they are. Oh Yes, I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points. Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good. Well, I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_? Yeah. Cool. Okay. So, be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Yeah. Oh we're all so proud of the. Okay, so that'll be a seven for A_. Could oh no, you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. Yeah. But that's alright. If you take a note of them, and then I'll put them in in a minute. Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for A_? Cool, okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user? Yeah. I mean Yeah. I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen. Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, but they can normally do most things right-handed, so I would say it's not such a big issue. Yeah. I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb. So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say? What do you what do you all think? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah? Because So you have to keep that side flat. So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but y you know, as long as that side's flat, than that will work. Okay. Um okay, so C_. Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_? There's a locator. Cool, so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though, doesn't it? To make it beep. Or a buzzer. Okay. So that's two, so that's seven, yeah. It's locatable? Fabulous. D_. Yeah. Yeah, and I mean d So, should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different, so, do you know, I mean it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first. So we give that one a five, you think? Yep. I'm glad you're accepting this. It has taken a little while, hasn't it? Um intuitive but Sorry, it's really hard to write on those. I just went a bit mad, didn't I? Um okay, cool, E_, okay. Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here, so possibly for left-handed. Investigate. So, should we give it a six? Six? I used to send fifty texts a day, you know, and I never got repetitive strain injury from that, so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest. Okay, so we give that a six, yeah. Okay, F_. Hang on, how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there? That's just Oh okay, cool. Um right, so. Yes, so that's a seven then. Um, cool. Yeah, but I mean you don't They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think.. Yeah, what do you all think? Six? Well, that's it, I mean Yeah, but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, hasn't it? So, I don't think many peop That's it, they can take it with them. So, we give it seven, and we write There we go. Cool. So, we need the average here, so we got Seven So we've got four sevens, so that's twenty eight, three sixes, eighteen. Two three four Seven eight. Okay, that's pretty good, I think. Um no, that's it, yeah. Cool, there we go.. There we go and there are the marks. Yeah. Yeah, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know. Yeah, you might end up having to take off the sample sensor.. No. We've got more than one pushbutton though, haven't we? 'Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? Not counting anything, we'd still be in budget. Twelve point five. No. Well it doesn't, but it uh And L_C_ display. This sample sensor. Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. Yeah. But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it? We can afford to get rid of it. So that means no locator, does it? I mean does Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. See, I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing, 'cause But that's well you would just have to to spin it down. So that's point three. Yeah, I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more. That's the spin wheel though, isn't it? Didn't that come with the L_C_ Yeah. Yeah. S so we're point three over. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Could b still put them on the side. But yeah. I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve, couldn't we? Yeah, but Yeah. Yeah. No. No, I don't think so. Yeah. We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway, and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think. Really? Cool. That's not a very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. Oh the the beeper thing. It Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate. You know, your pen vibrates? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can. Yeah. I think 'cause the meetings were so regular, you know. It wasn't like we were alone for very long, so you didn't st go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana, and then, you know, come back three days later and Jen's going look, look, it vibrates and it looks like a banana. Um yeah, so yeah. Uh I like the pens. I want one. That would just be so cool, to d do all your notes and s I don't think you should say that was the recording. Okay, cover up the microphone. Alright, let's take it. Okay. It is a bit limiting, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. The thing flew in, you didn't have the whole whooshing thing, 'cause there wasn't time for that, so yeah. Not that you can do that on the board, either. We could make some little Yeah, totally, I mean that was fairly tight anyway, I mean especially with that last-minute alteration. back it, this is just had to be changed. And yeah, so cool. Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now? Yeah, definitely. You weren't like a a dictating leader, so that was always good. I know you've got the pen, you might attack me with it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, I don't go shopping for remote controls that often, maybe somebody's already though of it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay. That looks boring, I'll see if anyone's made a remote control. Yeah, yeah. I think we'd like to think the ideas were new, but we've got no way of finding out. That vibrates Yeah, but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it. Yes. And it's fabulous. It's in the project documents. Yeah, yeah, sometimes it's like a little bit rushed. Yeah, we've got like five minutes left. Yeah. 'Kay. We could draw animals on the board again. I don't like Play-Doh, no. It's just minging. It smells so bad. It does. Mm. No, it hasn't been. Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now? Okay, so the other way.\n@highlight\nThis is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .\n@highlight\nwhat we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , It does look very cool .\n@highlight\nthen Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\n@highlight\nThen I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .\n@highlight\nUm and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .\n@highlight\nUm and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .\n@highlight\nso will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things Okay .\n@highlight\nSo um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\n@highlight\nYou think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\n@highlight\nWell , but it's it's just an a approximation .\n@highlight\nUm so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\n@highlight\nAnd it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .\n@highlight\nAnd we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside .\n@highlight\nAnd it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\n@highlight\nyeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\n@highlight\nUm it could be made a bit smaller , So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things .\n@highlight\nSo we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\n@highlight\nAnd then , well this is on off button .\n@highlight\nand and also the colour is quite often red , And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\n@highlight\nThe volume is is scrolling .\n@highlight\nOn the side , And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\n@highlight\nand and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose .\n@highlight\nOh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\n@highlight\nWell , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\n@highlight\nOn the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\n@highlight\nUh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\n@highlight\nyeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\n@highlight\nif it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\n@highlight\nBut if you hold it in , And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\n@highlight\nYou can't really see it in the interface .\n@highlight\nAnd it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\n@highlight\nYeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\n@highlight\nI suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\n@highlight\nSo what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .\n@highlight\nUm so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .\n@highlight\nUm , you know .\n@highlight\nBasically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .\n@highlight\nSo for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .\n@highlight\nI did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\n@highlight\nOkay .\n@highlight\nBut if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\n@highlight\nOkay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\n@highlight\nIf you take a note of them , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\n@highlight\nso y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\n@highlight\nSo maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?\n@highlight\nOr maybe six , It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\n@highlight\nYeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\n@highlight\nor are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\n@highlight\nth there's the locator dot .\n@highlight\nMm that you stick on T_V_ .\n@highlight\nso that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , To make it beep .\n@highlight\nso that's seven , yeah .\n@highlight\nIf uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .\n@highlight\nbut it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\n@highlight\nbut uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\n@highlight\nSo , should we maybe say f a five so possibly for left-handed .\n@highlight\nInvestigate .\n@highlight\nBut otherwise it's superb .\n@highlight\nSo , should we give it a six ?\n@highlight\nUm uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\n@highlight\nOkay , so we give that a six , G_ technologically innovative .\n@highlight\nit's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .\n@highlight\nWell mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new .\n@highlight\nAll of the components have been used in other things before .\n@highlight\nThey're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\n@highlight\nWhat do you reckon , five , six ?\n@highlight\nSix .\n@highlight\nPut fashion in electronics .\n@highlight\nFruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\n@highlight\nSo , we need the average here , So I think we've done very well , The average is about six and something .\n@highlight\nSix point five , yeah .\n@highlight\nthat's pretty good , I think .\n@highlight\nso we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .\n@highlight\nAnd now we have to calculate the production costs .\n@highlight\nSo I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .\n@highlight\nUm I started filling it in , No hand dynamo , right ?\n@highlight\nOne simple battery .\n@highlight\nThe chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\n@highlight\nWe also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\n@highlight\nUm single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\n@highlight\nCase material we said rubber .\n@highlight\nI don't know what special colour means .\n@highlight\nI think something coloured , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ?\n@highlight\nYou know .\n@highlight\nmaybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\n@highlight\nOr maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , We have pushbuttons , Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\n@highlight\nAnd we have L_C_ display And button supplements .\n@highlight\nYeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel We've got more than one pushbutton though , That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?\n@highlight\nThat seems unlikely .\n@highlight\nwhether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we We have to count all of them , I don't think that makes sense .\n@highlight\nif it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\n@highlight\nOur budget's twelve point five .\n@highlight\nYeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\n@highlight\nso that has implications though for the .\n@highlight\nUh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker .\n@highlight\nwhen you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .\n@highlight\nBut that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\n@highlight\nMm and the locator also goes away .\n@highlight\nWell the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\n@highlight\nA also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber .\n@highlight\nRight , so we need one fifty off .\n@highlight\nTake it down to just a scroll wheel .\n@highlight\nin the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ?\n@highlight\nhow do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\n@highlight\nBut how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\n@highlight\nyou can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\n@highlight\nSo that's point three .\n@highlight\nand I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\n@highlight\nThe scroll wheel is on the side .\n@highlight\nWe're point three over at the moment .\n@highlight\nUnless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .\n@highlight\nInstead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down .\n@highlight\nOh look , we're way under budget Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?\n@highlight\nOr or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\n@highlight\nSo did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\n@highlight\nNo , I don't think so .\n@highlight\nBecause we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .\n@highlight\ninstead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\n@highlight\nBut we lose the locator .\n@highlight\nso we still have the locate .\n@highlight\nWe're gonna have a beep .\n@highlight\nIt can come in the same colour as the the case .\n@highlight\nso it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\n@highlight\nas far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity .\n@highlight\nThe only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\n@highlight\nI think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\n@highlight\nIf we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\n@highlight\nBut in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\n@highlight\nI think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know .\n@highlight\nYeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\n@highlight\nthe whiteboard digital pens .\n@highlight\nWe like the pens .\n@highlight\nBut that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\n@highlight\nYeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\n@highlight\nI mean that was fairly tight anyway , But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\n@highlight\nYou weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\n@highlight\nAnd then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\n@highlight\nDid anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\n@highlight\nMm .\n@highlight\nI guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\n@highlight\nNew ideas found .\n@highlight\nNot quite sure what about .\n@highlight\nWell it's it's it's pretty new , I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , costs are within budget , One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .\n@highlight\nUm we've evaluated the project .\n@highlight\nCan you put that in the project documents file ?\n@highlight\nAnd the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .\n@highlight\nAnd my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\n@highlight\nsometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\n@highlight\nwe've got like five minutes left .\n@highlight\nbut if we've finished , then we've finished .\n@highlight\nYeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\n@highlight\nSo I would say that's the end of that meeting .\n@highlight\nRight , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\n@highlight\nWas there a questionnaire already sent ?\n@highlight\nDo we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\n@highlight\nI don't see why you can't stay here , really .",
    "summary": "The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is. They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand. They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time. They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete.",
    "actions": "The team needs to complete the final questionaire and meeting summary.",
    "decisions": "The remote will be black/yellow color and the shape of a banana. Remote flips open on side. LCD and push buttons inside flip-open door. The LCD will display the main menu, which offers various options. Has an on/off button, channel flipping, volume scroller on side. Corporate logo will be in grey. Remote uses one simple battery and an advanced chip. Single-curved surface. Rubber case material. Locator will have a beep instead of a speaker.",
    "problems": "When rating the product on how well it matches the user's behavior, they found that the product is more convenient for right-handed people and less so for those who are left-handed. When rating whether the product is intuitive, the layout is different,a good technology but less standard. It could be more difficult to get used to. The team had to cut out some features in order to make the budget. This happened because they had not known beforehand the cost of such features.",

However, we specified the =\nfollowing three goals about the project, namely that we want it to be =\noriginal, trendy and user friendly. The meeting did not satisfactorily =\nexplain my responsibilities in the project, but this might also be fine, =\nconsidering that we are in the very initial stage of the project.\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n[DECISIONS]   Name all decisions that were made during the meeting. =\nMark those decisions that you consider of high importance for your role =\nwith a *.

Then we calculated the production costs. It turned out that the estimated production costs were over the budject. Therefore, we had to slightly simplify the design, and removed some of the advanced, but non too necessary features - scroll button and the voice sampler. Since the voice sampler was also ment to be used when locating the remote control, we had to provide an alternative solution. We decided that it would just beep when the locator button that can be attched to the TV (or anywhere else for that matter) is pressed. The whole group was very satisfied with the design of the prototype. We expect the product to be great success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[DECISIONS]   Name all decisions that were made during the meeting.

The Project Manager introduced the =\nmeeting, and then we each gave a presentation based on what we had =\ndiscovered during out preparation time. The Industrial Designer provided =\na list of options for possible materials for the remote, which we =\nnarrowed down over the course of the meeting. The Interface Designer =\ngave some suggestions of the interface for the remote, suggesting a spin =\nwheel similar to that used on the ipod. I then presented my research on =\nthe latest trends, then there was group discussion where we decided on =\nthe materials and features of the remote. The Project Manager then =\nsummarised the meeting.\nDecisions made at the meeting:\n- To use a simple battery (combination of simplicity, practicality and =\nnecessity) *\n- The use rubber for the outer case (possibly an interchangable cover) =\nand to have it curved. The remotes should come in a variety of colours - =\ninspired by the fruit and vegetable theme. Use the company colors for =\nthe buttons etc. *\n- The interface is to consist of some push buttons, LCDs with spinning =\nwheel, and voice recognition *\n- Advanced integrated circuits will need to be used for the electronics\n- Sample sender/sample speakers need to be investigated further.\nNo real problems occured during the meeting, other that a lack of =\nknowledge as to the sample senders and sample speakers. These are not =\nparticularly important to my role.\nThe Designers are creating a prototype, including the look-and-feel =\ndesign (Industrial Designer) and the user interface design (Interface =\nDesigner), I will be working on the Product Evaluation.\nCat\nMarketing Expert\n----- Original Message -----=20\nFrom: HeadOfDept@ami=20\nTo: participant4@ami=20\nSent: Friday, January 28, 2005 2:57 PM\nSubject: Please summarise the last meeting\nDear Colleague,\n=20\nWould you be so kind to report to me on the past meeting?

After an initial brief of the project, team members introduced themselves and their roles (see present above). The project finances were outlined, and then initial ideas for the product were briefly discussed.\n\t [DECISIONS]   \n\t\n\t No decisions were made as this was an introductory meeting.\n\tThe initial ideas which were suggested by the marketing expert were agreed by the group - that we should go for a sleek look which fits with other products marketed by this company. This may involve having few or no buttons on the remote as many of these are rarely used anyway. \n\tThe user interface designer cautioned against  using a design which is too different from what consumers are used to as this will reduce the usability of the device.\n\t\n\t[ACTIONS]  \n\t \n\tActions to be taken:\n\tID: the working design\n\tUID: the technical functions design\n\tME: the user requirements specification  \n\tPM: liaise with management, prepare minutes and next meeting\n\t\nES2006docs.ES2006scen.ProjectDocuments.Minutes.of-meeting-2.doc \n------------ \nMinutes of second meeting\nTime: 12:05pm, 28 Jan. 05\nPresent: Jen (PM), Cat (ME), Gaurav (ID), Maarika (UID)\n[ABSTRACT]   \n This meeting brought together the initial individual work of the two designers and marketing expert. Each presented their ideas on working design, technical functions design and functional design respectively - presentations can be found in the project documents folder. Discussion followed, the result of which was a decision on target group and functionality\n\t [DECISIONS]  \n\tTarget group - 15-35 – this implies incorporating voice recognition\n\tDesign - small, sleek, sexy, but must follow some conventions for ease of use\n\tFunctionality - volume, channel, power, menu, no teletext\n\tLocator – perhaps to attach to TV\n\tTV only – unless we can make a case to management that other things (eg video, DVD) should be supported as well, as most other models do this\n\tVoice recognition (we need to investigate implications of this before committing fully) – would be great if it could recognise channels, not just numbers\n\t\n\t [PROBLEMS/ISSUES] \n\tSuggestions from management were incorporated with little trouble.\n\tAny extra functionality will make the chip bigger. This needs to be kept in mind during design. Likewise the cost implications of greater functionality.\n\tThe possibility of an LCD screen was not explored.\n\tThe design should be ergonomic to prevent RSI.\n\t\n\t[ACTIONS]  \n\t \n\tID: components concept\n\tUID: user interface concept\n\tME: trend watching\n\tPM: liaise with management, keep team updated\n\t \n\tAll to consider implications/feasibility of incorporating voice recognition and keep our target group in mind when designing.\nES2006docs.ES2006scen.ProjectDocuments.Minutes.of-meeting-3.doc \n------------ \nMinutes of second meeting\nTime: 14:15pm, 28 Jan. 05\nPresent: Jen (PM), Cat (ME), Gaurav (ID), Maarika (UID)\n[ABSTRACT]   \nThis meeting focussed on the concepts of the remote control, including components, properties, materials, user interface and response to trends. Each team member presented their findings and gave reasons for their preferred design choices. The meeting resulted in consensus on design specifications.\n\t[DECISIONS]   \n\t Technical specifications:\n\t- internal simple battery\n\t- rubber case, curved on 1 side, hinged to flip open\n\t- push buttons for power, volume and channels on outside\n\t- LCD display with spinning wheel on inside\n\t- voice recognition\n\t- advanced chip\n\t- sender and speaker if costs permit\n\t \n\t- 'fruit and vegetable' colours - orange, green, maybe red, yellow, purple\n\t- company colours can be incorporated in button design\n\t\n\t[ACTIONS]  \n\t \n\tID - look and feel design - model\n\tUID - user interface design - model\n\tME - product evaluation\n\tPM – final report"
