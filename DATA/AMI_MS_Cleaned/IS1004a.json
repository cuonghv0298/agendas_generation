    "transcript": "Okay. Good morning everybody. Oh, everybody is not ready. Alright. Okay, let's go. So, we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes. Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager. Um you are the Okay. Okay, very good. Thanks for being here. Um so let's have a look to the the agenda. So, we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here. Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it. So, the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control. Um it should be original, trendy, and also user friendly. As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company. It is in three step as you know. First the functional design. The second's a conceptual design, and then the detailed design. During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately, individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next. So first, we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings. So who want to start? Mister. You have one in mind? Okay. Th thank you. Very interesting. Guillermo you want to? It would be very funny for us. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Hemant. Poor elephant. Yes. We have to I have to catch you, sorry. We have to to go through the meeting. Thank you. Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants. So so another important part of the project is about money, uh and about so about finances. So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros, okay. And we should target the inter an international market. O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly, so let's go to it. So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go. Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device? Should it be a universal one? And uh etcetera. So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go. Okay. Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah. So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go. So we need to close the meeting. Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do. So um you have to work on the on the working design, you have to uh work on the technical functions, and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs, alright? Um you will receive some information by emails, i as usual. Thanks for coming today. Thanks.\nUh almost. Ready. I'm uh Michael. I'm the user interface designer. Ah well if no one else wants to, yeah. Okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal. Let's see. Well, I don't really have a favourite animal, but um uh I think I have one in mind, so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board. The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs, and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions. Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes. There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web. And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else. So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away. So, that's my animal. Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone. So you don't like pink panthers? So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant, 'cause you haven't drawn the ears? Okay. We can discuss that off-line. So could I just ask one question, um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something? Okay, alright. Okay well, so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet, but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so, I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know, what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control, so it's Yeah. Okay. Alright.\nGood morning. And I am Hemant, the industrial designer. But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther? So bad I don't like it. Um sure. Oh yeah. Thanks. This lapel is coming out once in a while. It's not very strong. Okay. So, not the favourite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant. I'll try to draw elephant. It's a problem. Okay, thanks. Okay so, elephant goes like this, and then it has four feet. I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest. And then we have it's trunk. And yep something like this. An eye, cute. Yeah, so and sometimes they have a hump. It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking. So when they walk, wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be. When they'll come to that position the second, the third feet will be there. That's the way they walk. And that's very peculiar about them. None of the other animals walk like this. And they are very useful to human beings. At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something, or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful. And they are found in um usually the warm countries. And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal. That's what I know about them. So, that's what I wanted to tell about elephants. There are two kind of uh yeah, they are very different, Indian and African elephants. So Indian elephant is having one bump, I think, and the African have two. And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals, these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there? Wind up? Okay, some other time. Thank you. Thanks. Marketing person. Mm-hmm. Thanks.\nHi I'm Guillermo. I'm the Marketing Expert. 'kay I dunno why, but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther, or maybe yes. Uh yeah yeah. Okay it's a friendly panther. Yeah maybe. Um. Actually, honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour, I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh, I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt, so but I like it because it's fast, and it's black as well, so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful, strong, uh I dunno. I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot. Okay. I like it. Yeah.\n@highlight\nSo , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes .\n@highlight\nUm so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager .\n@highlight\nI'm uh Michael .\n@highlight\nI'm the user interface designer .\n@highlight\nHi I'm Guillermo .\n@highlight\nI'm the Marketing Expert .\n@highlight\nAnd I am Hemant , the industrial designer .\n@highlight\nUm so let's have a look to the the agenda .\n@highlight\nuh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here .\n@highlight\nUm then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it .\n@highlight\nSo , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control .\n@highlight\nUm it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .\n@highlight\nAs usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company .\n@highlight\nIt is in three step as you know .\n@highlight\nFirst the functional design .\n@highlight\nThe second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design .\n@highlight\nDuring each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next .\n@highlight\nso uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings .\n@highlight\nOkay so , want me to draw my favourite animal .\n@highlight\nWell , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um I'm gonna about the uh spider I dunno why , but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant .\n@highlight\nDo we have some message there ?\n@highlight\nI have to catch you , We have to to go through the meeting .\n@highlight\nWe can discuss that off-line .\n@highlight\nso another important part of the project is about money , So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay .\n@highlight\nAnd we should target the inter an international market .\n@highlight\nis this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ?\n@highlight\nSo um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go .\n@highlight\nshould it be um specific remote control to some specific device ?\n@highlight\nShould it be a universal one ?\n@highlight\nso , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go .\n@highlight\nSo we need to close the meeting .\n@highlight\nSo um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual .",

    "decisions": "The project goal is to develop a new remote control. The target selling price will be 25 Euro dollars. They will target the international market. They will generate a proft of fifty million Euros.",
    "problems": "A group member asks whether it is going to be a stand-alone unit, or one that requires a T.V. beforehand. They did not decide yet what type of remote control to produce- whether it should be for a specific device or universal. The main concern is that they do not know what the product is, yet they have to make it fit that price bracket.",

We did the cost analysis and found that it is feasible to design the remote within our budget.\nDecisions: We decided to go ahead with the production after looking at the aspects. We found that it was a good remote because of its modularity, ingenious design, and simple user interface. Particularly the base station for finding the remote could be a very attractive aspect for buyers.\nProblems/Issues: The remote doesn’t have all the functionalities. And we need to see if we can extend it to be a remote for more than one device at the same time.\nActions: The real prototype of the remote is to be designed. A marketing survey needs to be done among the population to find out how it appeals to them.\nIS1004docs.Participant2.KickOff.Meeting.doc \n------------ \nSummary: In the meeting we discussed how we will try to approach the problem. Also, we draw one animal each on the white board.  Every one was assigned a job. Pricing details and expected profits were discussed.\nDecisions: Everyone was assigned one job related to the project of designing the remote control. I was assigned the job of making a Working Design. The functional designer was assigned he job of technical designs. \nProblems/Issues: We still need to discuss what kind of market we are tying to address (just remote controls for TV or some other devices also). Pricing seemed to be little high if we are trying to get only TV remote control.\nActions: First we must get the user requirements. A market survey is required to achieve this. Once the user requirements are known, we must look into the market from where we can get the relevant components to design the unit. We need to write software etc for the whole thing. I will be interested in a remote control which can be activated by voice.\nIS1004docs.Participant2.Second.Meeting.doc \n------------ \nSummary: In the meeting we discussed what kind of remote will be good. We worked on the interfaces we can use. Design issues were also discussed. We might go for LCD interface (but costs are prohibitive). ASR interface has been ruled out.\nDecisions: There is a possibility of scroll based user interface. LCD interface is not possible because of cost problem. ASR interface has been dropped out because of technology problems. Every one has been assigned one task. I have been assigned Component Concepts task.\nProblems/Issues: We are trying to address second replacement market of remote control. Pricing seems to be a bottleneck. Any advance technology will require considerable time and money investment. \nActions: I am going to find out what components are required for the remote control in the present setup. We want to have a remote control with the following interfaces:\nButtons (for traditional user)\nScroller (for young and technical savvy customers).\nMight be LCD screen (for customers with high income. But it still needs to be checked).\nA finder alarm device (to find the remote if it is misplaced).\nAlso, the components required for the remote are:\nInfrared rays emitter\nProgramming device to program infrared rays emitter\nPower Management of the remote\nInterface for tele-text control (some extra button or scroller itself)\nSafety aspects \nDurability (against shock due to falling, water resistance)\nPerformance measures (distance and angle) of the remote from the TV\nIS1004docs.Participant2.Third.Meeting.doc \n------------ \nSummary: In the meeting we discussed the functionality of the remote, its look and its interface. LCD, ASR and push buttons were ruled out. We decided to go with scroll buttons for volume control, channel selection and tele-text browising.\nDecisions: Shape of the remote is going to be banana. We will keep it simple. There will be a base station for charging rechargeable batteries and remote finder. It will have only scroll buttons.\nProblems/Issues: \nActions: The remote is to be designed with the help of Industrail designer and functional designer.\nIS1004docs.Participant3.summary01.doc \n------------ \nDear Colleague,\n \nWould you be so kind to report to me on the past meeting?

We did the cost analysis and found that it is feasible to design the remote within our budget.\nDecisions: We decided to go ahead with the production after looking at the aspects. We found that it was a good remote because of its modularity, ingenious design, and simple user interface. Particularly the base station for finding the remote could be a very attractive aspect for buyers.\nProblems/Issues: The remote doesn’t have all the functionalities. And we need to see if we can extend it to be a remote for more than one device at the same time.\nActions: The real prototype of the remote is to be designed. A marketing survey needs to be done among the population to find out how it appeals to them.\nIS1004docs.Scenario.Files.Meeting5.Participant2-KickOff-Meeting.doc \n------------ \nSummary: In the meeting we discussed how we will try to approach the problem. Also, we draw one animal each on the white board.  Every one was assigned a job. Pricing details and expected profits were discussed.\nDecisions: Everyone was assigned one job related to the project of designing the remote control. I was assigned the job of making a Working Design. The functional designer was assigned he job of technical designs. \nProblems/Issues: We still need to discuss what kind of market we are tying to address (just remote controls for TV or some other devices also). Pricing seemed to be little high if we are trying to get only TV remote control.\nActions: First we must get the user requirements. A market survey is required to achieve this. Once the user requirements are known, we must look into the market from where we can get the relevant components to design the unit. We need to write software etc for the whole thing. I will be interested in a remote control which can be activated by voice.\nIS1004docs.Scenario.Files.Meeting5.Participant2-Second-Meeting.doc \n------------ \nSummary: In the meeting we discussed what kind of remote will be good. We worked on the interfaces we can use. Design issues were also discussed. We might go for LCD interface (but costs are prohibitive). ASR interface has been ruled out.\nDecisions: There is a possibility of scroll based user interface. LCD interface is not possible because of cost problem. ASR interface has been dropped out because of technology problems. Every one has been assigned one task. I have been assigned Component Concepts task.\nProblems/Issues: We are trying to address second replacement market of remote control. Pricing seems to be a bottleneck. Any advance technology will require considerable time and money investment. \nActions: I am going to find out what components are required for the remote control in the present setup. We want to have a remote control with the following interfaces:\nButtons (for traditional user)\nScroller (for young and technical savvy customers).\nMight be LCD screen (for customers with high income. But it still needs to be checked).\nA finder alarm device (to find the remote if it is misplaced).\nAlso, the components required for the remote are:\nInfrared rays emitter\nProgramming device to program infrared rays emitter\nPower Management of the remote\nInterface for tele-text control (some extra button or scroller itself)\nSafety aspects \nDurability (against shock due to falling, water resistance)\nPerformance measures (distance and angle) of the remote from the TV\nIS1004docs.Scenario.Files.Meeting5.Participant2-Third-Meeting.doc \n------------ \nSummary: In the meeting we discussed the functionality of the remote, its look and its interface. LCD, ASR and push buttons were ruled out. We decided to go with scroll buttons for volume control, channel selection and tele-text browising.\nDecisions: Shape of the remote is going to be banana. We will keep it simple. There will be a base station for charging rechargeable batteries and remote finder. It will have only scroll buttons.\nProblems/Issues: \nActions: The remote is to be designed with the help of Industrail designer and functional designer.\nIS1004docs.Scenario.Files.Meeting5.Participant3-summary01.doc \n------------ \nDear Colleague,\n \nWould you be so kind to report to me on the past meeting?
