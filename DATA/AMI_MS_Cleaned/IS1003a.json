    "transcript": "So yeah I think you can do it. Twenty five Euros? Yep. Yeah. That's me. Okay. Yeah. No I'm user interf I'm user interface design. Okay. So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so I make uh u user interface. You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it. Make make yeah. Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh, it's the function design. I design the user f user interface, you design the function. Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And uh simple. And easy to use. Ah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah, you try. Try first. You can draw something which is very simple. Oh, maybe we should bring Kemy here. Kemy is really good at drawing. You're going to draw? Okay. What's this? It's a fat cat. Can you draw uh um rabbit? Oh, hat ha rat. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. Mm. Okay. Oh. Okay, I draw. The only thing I can draw is like this. Oh. Oh. Oh. No. What's this? Okay. Okay. The only thing I can draw, because it's very simple. Oh. Okay, be careful. No problem, no problem.. A person? Dog. Okay. Okay. So we have break. Oh. Hmm. No. Okay.\nYeah. Mm-hmm. So right now? Mm. It's reasonable, I think, yeah. Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI and okay. Okay. Okay, and Marketing Expert, it's me. You can manage all this, yeah. Good. Um. Not really. So which you, the Industrial Designer. Okay. Yeah. I mean, you have to know. Ah, you have to know it. It's your job, so I hope you you know what it is. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Well. You know. Oh, okay, okay. Not the other one. Yeah, I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer. Mm. Mm-hmm. And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty, so. That's the problem. Mm. It's clear. Yeah, maybe should go and draw an animal. Many Yeah. Uh it's the same as mine. It's the fat cat, okay. A rat? That's difficult. Yeah. Just go, you you the closest to the whiteboard. Jus Yeah. A duck. Pikachu. Oh yeah. Bugs Bunny one. Okay. I go. What? Oh. So what else? This was my favourite one, but Right. A fish. Oh yeah, doesn't look so fine. Okay, it's your turn. Mm. Good. I think it's done. Yeah. Oh, we have twenty five minutes for the meeting. Okay. Know what time is it? No. Good.\nAh okay. It's Ada Longmund? Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard, yeah? Yeah, I don't know. I it's it's reasonable, s quite yeah. Twenty five. Is Yeah. I I hope so I_D_ is for the Industrial Design, yeah? And U_I_D_, it's for the User Interface Designer, yeah? AMI yeah project. you will be the manager yeah. I am the Industrial Design, yeah I am the Industrial Designer so. It's difficult. You know very soon. So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Yeah. So the materi Okay right. But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know. But I don't know. Okay. I'm the industrial designer. So. Okay. So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay. It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, I don't know. Is it? Are we supposed to do right now? Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now. Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it, so. It's not matter So. yeah. It's a It's a cat. It is not a fat cat. Yeah, it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat. It's your rat. Okay, go right, but in grow, it's everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea, so It's a rabbit. It's not so bad so. So you don't have a A fish. That's a that's a fish? Okay, let's try to draw something. Have to be really careful. Ah it's my turn. Okay. So. It's ok So, what can I draw some more?? No. Mm Yeah, it's it's a se it's my priority this one. Yeah. No. It's a really crazy dog Okay. Transfer. It's a dog in a village. So what are you sug going to do now? It's done? Oh my God. Yeah, it's okay. We have an idea yeah. I have an idea of my job so yeah so. Yeah.\nSo we can start? Suppose I have to do my presentation. Eh um So, I'll present myself, I'm Ada Longmund, and as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager. So um we will have to um speak about m the project. Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control, so the remote control has to be original, trendy and um user-friendly. Record. So the project method is the following. So if we're um the functional design, you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other. Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design. Uh. The tool training is to try out the white board, so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later. So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's quite good price, yeah. And uh it will uh be a an international remote control, as we want to sell it in the entire world, and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. So, as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control. Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls, try to create something new and people would like to to buy. And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do. And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. Yeah. I_D_, yeah. So So I will manage all all the group. So you have questions? So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do. Mm-hmm. And you? Mm okay. Hmm. I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. And i maybe you will transform it. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. And yeah. And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product. So you don't have to do something really specific, as everybody everybody will have to use it, it's sor the same as keyboards. You know, you have Qwerty, Azerty, French and U_K_ keyboard, so really the remote control to be international. And not too expensive. As we want to maximise the benefit. Yeah, you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros. And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now. So, is it okay? So you think we have to do it now? You want me to draw something? Product manager okay, let's go, I will try. No. A mouse is not too difficult. Mouse is okay. You love the eyes. Yeah, that was the eyes. A clown. Rabbit. It's a rabbit. Yeah. Thank you. You forgot the chips. Fish and chips. Of Oh.? Oh yeah. Yeah, I think yeah. Just have to present project, discuss a little bit about it. Yeah. So, if you have questions. It's okay? You know your job? you know your job? You know your job?

The user interface designer emphasized the fact that the remote control needs to be elegant and easy to use (similarly to Google). The industrial designer proposed to use infrared technology to meet the cost reqirements, and I presented a user study showing that the user wants a fancy and simple remote control with a minimum number of buttons. Baba's wired remote control did not make the overall agreement, while the yellowish design proposed by the project manager did.    \n \n \n[DECISIONS]   Name all decisions that were made during the meeting.

Solar power supply will be used and part of the material will be wood, as brought by the industrial designer Baba. The user interface designer David pushed for speech and gesture recognition, but it was discussed to be a risky technology for a first implementation. The fashion trends are fruits and vegetables, and the fancy look-and-feel seems to be the key point from a user point a view.

It is mainly based on a rotating yellow ball (lemon like?) to zap between channels with a coarse-to-fine strategy. A base with solar cells reloads the device. I conducted an evaluation of the prototype based on three criteria: (i) Fancy Look and Feel, (ii) Technologically Innovative, (iii) Easy to use. This evaluation gave a good score to the solution (mean of 3 on a 1 to 7 scale, 1 being ‘yes’). The main point of this meeting was a necessary redesign of the solution to reach the 12.50 Euros cost goal.   \n\t \n\t[DECISIONS]   Name all decisions that were made during the meeting.
