    "transcript": "Okay, it's a I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas. Okay. Now do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. Um for one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_. As it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick, though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh ju just a thought. You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round, so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other. But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand, the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design. Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down. Yeah. this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing. Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. As for the um as for the single curve, um well this edge and this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it's not absolutely necessary. Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this. Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder. So. Any further comments? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I mean the uh Yeah. Yeah. I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand. One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber, I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure. So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely. Mm. Lovely. Um. Okay. Yeah, that's still part of the design. Mm. Mm. And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple. Mm-hmm. I'd say number one. I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile, you can hear it, but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is. Bu Yeah. Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger. Mm. So that uh th Mm. Mm. yeah. Mm. Mm. I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control. Mm-hmm. Um yeah I mean one thing, I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation? This is what I'm wondering. Oh no, I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved. It's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation. Mm. Yeah, I mean and I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here, the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight. Um I mean yeah, on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves. The curve that's really needed is up here, to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand. Mm. Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about. But I thought it was just completely pointless. Yeah. Alright. B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could, you know, say hello to, and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay, well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose. Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room. Or grey. Yellow. Okay. Three. I think we can do three. Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference. It makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap, it stands out from the rest of the crap. Two buttons and a joystick. Totally. It doesn't get much fancier. Mm. Mm. I'd give it a three for this for that. Yeah. I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote, but you see it in a lot of other places. Mm-hmm. I'd give it a three. Mm-hmm. I'd s I I'd give it a six, to be honest. Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours. Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow. If I were buying one, I'd go for purple. Leopard print would be cool. That's kinda i it won't be when it's been budgeted. I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie. Um. Mm. I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually. Mm. Mm. Personally, I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control that you've already got, are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good? Mm-hmm. I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative, um for someone who's sort of technophobic, the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting. Um. Yeah, got notes and doodles. Well I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this. It's all p goes into their corpus. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves.. Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along, squish. Yeah. Mm. I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh in added expense. Such as it is. Actually I want th one thing I would say I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget um m would make to sales. And we could even you know, market two versions. Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber. Yes. Mm. And I can get my bus. Okay. Thank you.\nUm obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks, because it's gonna be flat on one side, so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this, won't it? 'Cause it you can't get it curved. Uh because of costs. And it's plastic as well, so it won't be as comfortable on the hand. Yeah,. One. Yeah. What about what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote. Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually. Mm. Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker. Mm. That's too expensive isn't it? Yeah. Fashion. So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now. Oh, and joystick, yeah. So The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of the remote. But that's what makes it uh original though, isn't it? It can be s yeah, it can still be single curved, but You just. That's what we need for the joystick I think though. Costs four. Yeah. Are we going for a special colour at all? Well I was for a case. Or had you already incorporated that? Think it's ten minutes left. Special colour. Three. Are we going one on? I'd say we go two, 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved. Wouldn't it? With the articulators. With bells on it. No need for teletext. five? Six? Six,. Put a leopard print on it. Yeah we gotta. I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that, that's that'd stand out. Logo, brand. Mm 'kay. Yellow courgette. Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto, like. And we're we're not doing well on it. Yeah, I'll go with five. 'S bad design, that thing. Mm, yeah. Well, it depends who your who's what the target people are, like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going, oh look at that, 's cool, it looks like a it's yellow, looks like a banana, it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room. Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good, it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick. So, which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it?. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Very good. We're burs bursting with creativity. And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost. And would it have to be twice that? It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro. We'll still settle for twenty five. Maybe. In the beginning, yeah.\n. Right. Yeah I've got a if you load up my evaluation document. Mm. Uh evaluation. Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. Um then we will it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process. So um not seven steps, seven scale. So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype. And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those I put together from the user requirements phase. 'Kay. Um if you flip the So, those are the criteria. And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points. Put it mildly. So we have um true? One, t Seven, eight, oh. Fourth. Okay, so we have to go through each point. If we imagine it's actually straight, and just give it a a score. So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. I mean, uh is the homing thing still the locator, is that still Sure. And Adam, we can keep that in? Okay. Sure. T Sure. Mm. Bright colour. So we still have that noise thing, yeah? Os on a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? Number one? Okay. Number number one for the first criteria. Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You wanna say something? That's fine. Oh that's that's fine. What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna Um, a few. Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion. So they say we put the fashion in electronics, well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion, so. That's this bit right here. And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, so it's kinda condensed into one. And we can come back to it, you said. So. Different languages? Yeah. Mm. Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um?. Yeah, yeah. Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together? That's quite significantly expensive.. Yeah. We don't even have uh speakers here. The like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? Have we factored that in? Transmitter, receiver, speakers. Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_. Is that gonna be a button, or Yeah. I I mean it's not on here, but um. Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_? Okay. Well that's yeah. What's a hand dyna dynamo? You have to wind it up? Technology. Yeah. Okay. And we couldn't replace the joystick, right? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it, up down left and right, and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Uh k Does this does this bear in mind that I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it, like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components, you know. Mm. 'Kay. I think so. Yeah. Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface? 'Cause like we do we have re restrictions on software? Oh but there has to be joystick. Okay. Sure. Okay, my bad. So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria. Oh, wait a minute. Sample speaker? What is a sample speaker? Is that somewhat similar to what we want? Yeah. You got a email about voice response? I did not, so. We won't go with that one, did you say? I mean I we Okay, okay. So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing. Okay. Okay. Oh, special colour for the case. Mm-hmm. W what's the default colour? White or black? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay. Okay. So uh Right okay. Okay. 'Kay. Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Um. Okay. Special colour. Uh uh four. Three if we're being generous, I feel. Think we're being generous here with three. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Reduce the number of unused buttons. We're down to t two buttons, is it? Okay, so that's a one. You know, where that's Okay, that was good. Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus that's yeah that's good. 'Kay that's we're not doing so badly. Um easy to use oh okay, let's forget that one. Fancy looking. Sure. And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_. Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display. Maybe I was panicking for no reason. Yeah, w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah. There we go. Yeah, that's m that's that's better too. More accurate numbers. Technologically innovative. Well, we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, mobile phones. And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control, so it's You say three? I might go as far as two on that. Three. Three. Okay. Okay. Materials that people find pleasing. Sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. Yeah. That's true. It's not a step backwards. Yeah, okay let's give it a six. Okay, that's totally thrown everything off balance. Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. W we could. What colour were we gonna make it? I know, but But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg, Yeah. Mm. But Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing. Is this like a banana type colour? Could we stretch no still, it's not shaped like a banana is Oh is that 'cause it's flat? What is what fruit or veg is flat? Yeah. Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well. Four? Oh that's it's very ambitious, yeah, um. Sure. Inspired by. Yeah. This is their strategy. I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks. Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one. I would say I mean it's it's not at all, right? In any way or shape or form. We didn't m Okay, the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay. Right five. Is that sound reasonable? Five. Yeah. 'Kay, so we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. Which gives us an average of three. It's well this would be in the middle. So we it's it's not bad. It's in the good section. Oops. Sorry. I'm I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven, we were to go down a grade to to four, we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic. You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things, so I think we're definitely on the good bit. Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven, that's still only three extra points over seven. You know, it's yeah, we did it w it was okay. It was good. Mm-hmm. I think so. I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone, and she's had it for a long time, you know. She uses it to make phone calls and that's it. Yeah. So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick, I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy, you know. She'd be like is this a remote control, I don't how do you use it, and stuff like that. So even if it is really user friendly to us, but we're used to using menus all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons, yeah. But like radical good, maybe. Wrote nearly a page, but not. I think tracking. Yeah, that woulda been pretty good. I'd yeah I liked it, yeah. I li yeah, top marks. Well yeah. We we're not lacking in ideas, you know it's that was not the problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah, to begin with. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And like response from consumers. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's Thank you. I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff. It's like man, we we can't have the locator thing. And s yeah that's just bad. Do you think maybe the prices were were made?\nThat should hopefully do the trick, um. 'Kay. Sorry about the small delay. Falling a little bit behind schedule. And that's uh fifteen twenty five. Okay. So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it? Uh The new black, I believe. Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, though we should never avoid functionality, of course. Uh many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display. Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. Okay. So um due to your hard work, we might as well let the uh two designers go first, and uh show us the prototype. Quite how the best way to do this is, I'm not sure, but Okay. I'm afraid yeah. We'll go into that a bit more, but please go on. Mm. Okay, yeah. Great. Um. Yeah, okay. Excellent work. Um. Yeah, I believe so. So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost, 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element, but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have. Mm. Um just before we go through all of the steps here, um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright. Yeah, is that Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others? Okay. Okay. No and which we will do very very shortly. Um. Okay. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well. Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, require more buttons, etcetera. Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in, we've got point two of a Euro left over there. So we're just managing it really. Even then as well, um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now. Um. That should still be viable. We've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the L_C_D_. So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility. Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here. We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be. Um. We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person. Okay. It very much is about making concessions, unfortunately. Um. Um b b b da is you mean on the plastic, or? Let's have a look. You now have as much information as I do. Um. So as you can see here, for example, the battery really not very little choice in that one. We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to. I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost, which I've had to very much make advantage of, despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit. Problem comes here as you can see in the interface. Um if I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. That might make sense, because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what, four point five Euros, which is an awful lot, so that could well be wrong. Even if we save point five there, it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit, which has had to be put to one side. As you can see, the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick. I that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters. Um as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price. So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go, but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired, this one comes in under price as you can see, but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design. Uh no, we haven't, not That'll it literally would just be a button. We might have to It looks like almost nothing Mm. Oh good call, I missed that. that's a very valid point. So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display, then that's I believe so, yeah. That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such, yeah. Being manipulated by the joystick, yeah. Which I'm defining as scroll wheel. Um. Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be, that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation. If we remove the L_C_ display, we could save ourselves a fair amount. Which you could It's a shame. We should possibly have If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to. Again, you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one. Um but for the purposes of this meeting, I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures. So, I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us, despite the cost it's gonna incur. Um are people maybe not happy with, but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case, to keep the L_C_D_? It's hard to tell. Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation. Single curved with articulation? But the curves all o over hand, is it? We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway, so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation. Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal. Which is what we can get onto now. As long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well, but we're gonna say um single curved design It could well be, but at a cost of Okay, yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one. Yeah, that's voice recognition, so. Um. So, okay yeah, battery definitely, It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros, um. Maybe even slight well oh yeah, pretty much point two Euros, I'd say. So we'll leave that one for now. we'll just have It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure. One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right. So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more. Um. At which point if Well you got point five there. It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct. I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button. So There we go. Black's probably the normal colour you'd say, yeah. I quite like that colour that you're fetching there, it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better. So will we go with that then? It's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go. Just to give you an idea, um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well, I'm not sure how much time. We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet, but. Ten. Mm mm four? Three? Mm. Okay. Two buttons. Yeah. I'd say we're doing well there. Mm-hmm. As he models the I'd Yeah. Which is a shame. Mm. I'd be tempted with three, yeah. We'll get panned on the next one, anyway. Yeah, w It is, yeah. Don't blame them. Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such. Plastic, it sucks. But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have. Like yellow, yeah. It would also help keep the the product placement s yeah. Is it inspired by clothing fashion? Yes. It's kind o it probably Well I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg, so, what, four? Is that being too generous? Oh dear,. What would you think yourself? Well, it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. Si it's got a curve to it. Am I do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana? It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen. Um. Y oh and you've knocked batteries out. Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased, um it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly, based on um the the cost features. Maybe it's been targeted Hide it in the fruit basket. Probably the people technologically. They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um don't know how lo much longer we've got. At least five minutes I think. Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation. Um. So, we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction. Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them? For example um we'll work backwards I suppose. The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with. Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper? I would say I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. Mm. It must It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes. So maybe this is literally just a way around it. Um I dunno. How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? Leadership. As much as can be leadered in this uh thing. Um last one we've got is room for creativity. Now, I think we got Yeah I think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. Not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. It's a bit of a pity. Um I would have to agree on that. I think we needed a larger budget. If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector, then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is. Because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market. Mm. It could even That's true, yeah. Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess. As to a the costs involved. But I mean we've got a a prototype. So I dunno, I I think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and um such. Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end, I would have to agree. It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. Always hard to tell until you know the costs. Um. Okay. Are the costs within budget? Well, they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product. We've evaluated it, and we can say that we came out with a value of three. It's yeah? And then the final one where you get to call it Hal. But we'll go into that later. Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add, um anything they think that's not been covered, before I quickly write up a final report. Um I dunno, I mean we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be, but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers. There is a huge market. I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that. Yeah. So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add, we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such. Yeah? Uh thank you for your participation. That a question we can ask.\n\n\n\n@highlight\n\njust to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera .\n\n@highlight\n\ndue to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype .\n\n@highlight\n\nQuite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas .\n\n@highlight\n\ndo uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ .\n\n@highlight\n\nAs it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design .\n\n@highlight\n\nthis design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .\n\n@highlight\n\nThough I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well .\n\n@highlight\n\nI I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .\n\n@highlight\n\nAs for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , Really the curve that's most needed is the underside Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .\n\n@highlight\n\nif we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by .\n\n@highlight\n\nit's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process .\n\n@highlight\n\nseven scale .\n\n@highlight\n\nafter we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase .\n\n@highlight\n\nthose are the criteria .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe have to go through each point .\n\n@highlight\n\nand just give it a a score .\n\n@highlight\n\nuh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still Yeah , that's still part of the design .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , Mm .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing , on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI'd say number one .\n\n@highlight\n\njust before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ?\n\n@highlight\n\nis that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion .\n\n@highlight\n\nSomething I neglected from my initial research That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , And we can come back to it , you said .\n\n@highlight\n\nSlight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs we've got point two of a Euro left over there .\n\n@highlight\n\nEven then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ .\n\n@highlight\n\nI really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place .\n\n@highlight\n\nMm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?\n\n@highlight\n\nYou now have as much information as I do .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI've said single curved .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm plastic for some reason incurs no cost , if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button .\n\n@highlight\n\nAs you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .\n\n@highlight\n\nI'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .\n\n@highlight\n\nuh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ?\n\n@highlight\n\nHave we factored that in ?\n\n@highlight\n\nUh no , we haven't , not Transmitter , receiver , speakers .\n\n@highlight\n\nPlus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ .\n\n@highlight\n\nThat's too expensive Mm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures .\n\n@highlight\n\nI would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation ?\n\n@highlight\n\nUm I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , it can still be single curved , Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ?\n\n@highlight\n\nso I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .\n\n@highlight\n\nSample speaker ?\n\n@highlight\n\nWhat is a sample speaker ?\n\n@highlight\n\nthat's that voice response thing that we got the email about .\n\n@highlight\n\nBut I thought it was just completely pointless .\n\n@highlight\n\nB i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice .\n\n@highlight\n\nit looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing .\n\n@highlight\n\nOne point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right .\n\n@highlight\n\nl let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , Yellow .\n\n@highlight\n\nmake it glow in the dark even better .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe'll come back to uh your evaluation Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost .\n\n@highlight\n\nThree .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think we can do three .\n\n@highlight\n\nReduce the number of unused buttons .\n\n@highlight\n\nI'd say we're doing well there .\n\n@highlight\n\nEasy to use interface , buttons menu , menus we're not doing so badly .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm easy to use let's forget that one .\n\n@highlight\n\nFancy looking .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt doesn't get much fancier .\n\n@highlight\n\nTechnologically innovative .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe're getting rid of the locator thing Mm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI'd give it a three for this for that .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , Materials that people find pleasing .\n\n@highlight\n\nSponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently .\n\n@highlight\n\nPlastic , it sucks .\n\n@highlight\n\nMm-hmm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest .\n\n@highlight\n\nthat's totally thrown everything off balance .\n\n@highlight\n\nInspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion .\n\n@highlight\n\nI I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype Leopard print would be cool .\n\n@highlight\n\nBut um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , It would also help keep the the product placement Is this like a banana type colour ?\n\n@highlight\n\nit's not shaped like a banana is I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , Mm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion .\n\n@highlight\n\nIs the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions .\n\n@highlight\n\nand we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like .\n\n@highlight\n\nYeah , I'll go with five .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one .\n\n@highlight\n\nWhich gives us an average of three .\n\n@highlight\n\nit's it's not bad .\n\n@highlight\n\nconsidering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?\n\n@highlight\n\nwhich which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?\n\n@highlight\n\nProbably the people technologically .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction .\n\n@highlight\n\nDoes anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ?\n\n@highlight\n\nUm people made good use of the uh pen and paper ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this .\n\n@highlight\n\nThough it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves .\n\n@highlight\n\nHow are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ?\n\n@highlight\n\nGood .\n\n@highlight\n\nyeah I liked it , Leadership .\n\n@highlight\n\nAs much as can be leadered in this uh thing .\n\n@highlight\n\nVery good .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm last one we've got is room for creativity .\n\n@highlight\n\nUnti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , We're burs bursting with creativity .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe we're not lacking in ideas , Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think we needed a larger budget .\n\n@highlight\n\nMm .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such .\n\n@highlight\n\nMaybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah , to begin with .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget um m would make to sales .\n\n@highlight\n\nis there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um before I quickly write up a final report .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell .\n\n@highlight\n\nbut we've got something unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such .\n\n@highlight\n\nI was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff .",
    "summary": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features. The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product. The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost. After discussing costs, the team returned to conducting their product evaluation. The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced, ease of use, appearance, technological innovativeness, and sponginess. Overall, the prototype received average marks. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget.",

The lower section contains another irregular enclosed shape with multiple boxes and text inside it. The boxes are labeled \"new ny,\" \"old,\" and \"log.\" There is also an \"OK+\" near the right-middle. Another label in the upper part says \"yellow reed,\" but part of the text is somewhat unclear.\n\nThis drawing seems to resemble a schematic or diagram with labeled parts, perhaps indicating a process, components, or sections of a system or device."

What audience will be targetted and expected return from target audience.\n\n\n\n  Interface designer will have to wait until the requirements are in before he can really design the interface. However, some features are common to all remote controls. He can begin designing those features or deciding whether the remote will be so radical that even the most basic features are done away with.\n\n\n\n  Industrial engineer will have to consider which materials are available at the given price. Also, engineer will have to wait for requirements as the use of the remote will determine which material. For example, a nice soft material may be great for attracting a certain audience, but if the remote is to be used for long periods of time, daily, then the soft material may simply wear away quicker. A more sturdy remote would be more appropriate. However, if the remote is to be used as conventional remotes are used, then the sturdyness is nnecessary. Please note that I have never come across a soft remote but was just using it as an example.\n\u0000"

The idea of a LCD and joystick was instead chosen based on users previous use of mobile phones. This small number of buttons should allow for a wide range of designs to allow the product to stand out. The concept of losing the RC was pursued and it was decided to include a design that allows audio and visual localization. This would be activated by a device placed on the side of the TV or if a deal with a manufacturing company is met then inside the TV .\n\n\nRemote Control requirements are as follows\n\nMonochrome LCD large enough to comfortably show enough information for navigation.\n\nDual-purpose joystick for either navigating LCD display or up-down function for volume and left-right for channel switching.\n\nPower button in addition to 2 other buttons. One to start LCD navigation and another to confirm selection.\n\nSmall (possibly battery operated) transmitter for locating the RC if lost. Transmitter to be secured somewhere to be chosen by user\n\nSpeaker and bright LED to be used to allow location when transmitter is used.\n\nDesign to be in keeping with ergonomics but still unique and including company logo"

Initially the market is replacement RC units with the possibility of supplying to TV manufacturers.\n\n\n\nWith the market today, Real Reaction will have to produce something that stands out in the concept of remote controls. The aim is to make use of consumers familiarity with mobile phones. The use of a LCD panel for navigation purposes connected with a joystick makes use of peoples knowledge and muscle memory to control the TV. The secondary goal of this venture was to create a remote control that was able to aid in locating itself in the event of being lost. This was envisaged by use of a small transmitter attached to a large unit such as the TV so that the transmitter can not be lost.\n\n\n\nInitial design decisions were the use of the LCD in conjunction with a joystick to minimize the interface. The use of a speaker and transmitter to aid locating the remote control. The limited interface allows a more unusual form to be investigated to help the unit stand out from the competition.\n\n\n\nThese ideas were followed through the second meeting in which it was decided that an advanced chip and LCD were to be used in keeping with the minimal interface. It was also pointed out that a keypad could be required but the decision was the LCD negated this requirement. It was also decided that a single unit could then be used in various countries as the chip could handle multi language support.\n\n\n\nCosts meant that in the final meeting the use of a rubber skin for feel appeal would have to be removed as would a double curve design. The concept of locating the unit after losing it would also have to be shelved for this model to bring it under costs. What makes the unit unique is potentially now lost but further analysis is required."
