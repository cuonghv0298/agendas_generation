    "transcript": "No. Ninja Homer, made in Japan. And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions? So the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use. Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial? Okay 'cause The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing. If you're using an advanced function right, like um c brightness, contrast, whatever, it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns, it's a very simple L_C_D_ like, whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast. It might even be one, a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the the symbols of the various functions. That's a number pad. Um they're al along this Yeah. You have this space here, and then you have this thing on the side as well, or at the bottom. 'Cause slogans are usually quite small, right, they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about say a button's about this size, right, so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan, say even for that. Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button, so one two three four centimetres. Plus maybe half o five six seven eight, about yeah nine total. Nine, ten. Yep. Excuse me. Sure. Oh we've discussed how h high it is, but how wide is it? No as in the height, but what about the width? Do we need five? I don't think five is be about th three and a half. Yeah, yeah. Okay things like um brightness, contrast, um maybe tuning the channels. Um. What else? Um the various inputs. Are you having a V_C_R_, are you having you know which input do you have? Um. Yep, colour, sharpness. Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them. Audio, we have like your basic y your base, your mid-range, your high range. Um. Yep, left-right balance, um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes, like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes, and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting. Yeah. The battery. No. Um. We need an Yep. Yeah advanced chip. We need an advanced chip I think, yep. Let me just confirm that. Yes I think so. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Plastic. I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber. Um. Yep. For the case itself, one colour. It's one special colour. 'Cause the case unit itself, the rest of our components go on top of it. Yes. One and the L_C_ display. How many We've got push buttons as well. Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one. Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons, so maybe four again. 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons. So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less. No. Yep. Yep. How much would that save us? That will only save you one. The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together, um because when you do something on the T_V_, the T_V_ responds and reacts as well, so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond, which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep. And the advanced chip goes away as well. Regular chip. Yep. So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there. Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah, so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons, four, eight, twelve. It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone, underneath there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. We just report that it has to be over budget, or the colours, you could take away s colours for th for the buttons. Normal coloured buttons. No that's not the button we're talking about. That's the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off uh? Hey it's back to the original. Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons, so that might be some some way of cutting the cost. Yeah. What do you mean by profile? No. We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_. So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add, and you might want to add in the report, length, width, and height. Yeah. Yeah. Two. This is about this is about two. Slightly more than two, so Okay. I think that's something that's very hard to catch, so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something. The the look and the colour is something which is cool, but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change, rather than rather than positioning, 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad. Maybe we should do the design evaluation first. I don't think you need the power, so No, that's okay that's okay. No, the power cord itself. Yeah, so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers. You killed a monster. I rate that pretty highly. Yep I'm fine with that. It's one to seven, right? Wait, what's the scale, one to seven, right? Okay, it's upside-down. Say it's more medium, but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing. Yep. Lemon. Okay, the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour, except for the b the the red button, they because for want of a Yeah, the the yellow is more representative of the colour, but the button itself, the blue can be anything else. Yep, that's fine. Yeah, company logo. I think it'll be cost prohibitive, yeah. Yep. The cameras did. Yep. It keeps getting too big. 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing, so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well. Just in case you're wondering, why is he still playing with the Play-Doh? Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego. You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage, it can only go so big and not hit the side. The constraints do come in very fast. Yeah. I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings, so time is also a very s um strong factor, and structure. Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed, um to be evaluated, and to be reviewed, and to get feedback and come back. And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that, I think that's a very big thing, and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses, right, and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate. I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment, rather than the equipment is helping me, and you know. Not not so much an atmosphere, the atmosphere is very relaxed, but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts Excuse me. I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured. I think structure is probably what you're saying that, each individual is structured to one particular task, and one parti rather than controlling. I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a, like a consensus right, we go around and we think about it, but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way. It doesn't tell you, you know, some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know, not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate, but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a, you know, a messenger will go. Yeah. Okay. I think the tools that they were given, the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration, I think that's the word. They don't support the team working together, you know, they're still very individual tools. We had Play-Doh fun. No, not really. I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard, and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think. It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint, or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place, you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings. 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that. And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints, I don't think, you know, we needed to actually it could have, we could have gone through it verbally, especially my slides, I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them. Yep clunky. Agreed. Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well, 'cause you're half way through a thought, and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump. But I think the pen is v is very intuitive, everybody knows how to use it, we don't have to worry. So I think the pen's good. It's about the best thing. Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something, you know, it's useful but I think too many computers are just distracting. Um Yep. And we have Ninja Homer. Ninja Homer. See it looks like Homer Simpson but it's electronic so it's made in Japan. Yeah it's just a logo. Ninja Homer. The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it. You can wear Homer, you can throw Homer when you're frustrated, doh. It's clunky. Oh, I did learn something new, Play-Doh is useful. No it is it is. It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing, in being creative. 'Cause like you say, it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for. Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else. You might wanna write that down. It's just, I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh, and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool. No, all Play-Doh is edible. It's just wheat, it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh It's helpful to the creative process. Um it engages all your senses not just your sight, but your sense of feel your sense of touch. And it helps you to understand dimension as well. I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up, whereas on a piece of paper, on a computer, on a board, um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still, it requires a lot of yeah tangible, that's a nice word. It becomes tangible. Nope. I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate. Can we turn off the microphones?\nOkay we all all set? Right. Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting. Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design, the user interface design, and we're gonna evaluate the product. And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control, like absolute final decision, um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report. So um just from from last time to recap, we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display, no need for talk-back, it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing, um hopefully a jog-dial, and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well. Anything I've missed? Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be Mm-hmm. Okay cool. Oh right okay. Cool. Where are we gonna have the slogan? Okay cool. Okay. Okay. So if this isn't to scale, what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here? Mm-hmm. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So we're talking about ten centimetres. That would be good. So ten centimetres in height. Okay um. Yeah. That's great and it's very bright as well. So um okay. Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay so that's like an okay button, right. Okay. Oh oh like depth of the actual thing. Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay. So you can power on and off, what else can you do? Okay. Okay jog-dial for volume. And what else do you do with the jog-dial? Contrast, brightness, yeah, and anything else? Well of the designers what are they? Uh-huh. Okay channel tuning. That's a good one. Okay auxiliary inputs. Sharpness. Okay what about uh sound settings? Uh d can you change any of those at all? Okay. Okay, is there anything else at all it can do? That 'cause that's that's fine. Just need to know so I can write it down. Okay um right I g I guess that's it, so we can now um We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing, and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all. So um for this first part here power-wise, have we got battery? Do we have kinetic as well? No. Okay, just battery. And that's because of cost restraints is it? Okay um what about the electronics here? Advanced chip. Okay um the case, what does it mean by single and double, do you know? So we want double-curved? Okay. Um. Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay, um and we wanted special colours didn't we? So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there? Just one colour, okay. Okay so interface-wise, is it this third option we have, the two of them there? Okay and then buttons, we have what, two colours? Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Four. So w why are we arriving at the number four? Where does the number four come from? Okay right, so we're writing down four. Okay. How about these? Are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic? Okay. So we're w w quite far over. Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go. Um we're at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro, so let me see, what are we I mean oh yes sorry, four point three. My maths is all out. Yeah. How much would that save us? One. Okay so So w what's our reviewed suggestion? Um take away the L_C_ display? To be replaced with a regular chip. Okay. And so we've got point three to get rid of. Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now? Twelve buttons. Yeah. Do you think? Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons, how can it be something in between? Mm. Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere. Mm. No can do. Well do you want colour differentiation here? Oh yeah sorry yeah then. Right so Ah. That's it. Okay, ach that's a shame. Um right, so take away that completely? Ah. And now we're under budget. So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted. Um Doesn't say so. Yeah that's a good idea. Just one? Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay. Well well there we go. So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now. So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore, and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing, which I think is fair enough, and so this is gonna be one big thing here. Um. Right okay. So just to well to be thorough then, width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something? Okay and then so height-wise How how tall do you envisage it being? About that big? About two centimetres, okay. Okay. Ach, that is Yeah. Okay we'll s we'll say two point five. Okay um so we have it within cost anyway. Um so yeah project evaluation is this point. Um. Right uh. Okay so can we close that? This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be. Someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine. Okay. Right um. So at this point we uh, let me see, discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points, with the room for creativity in the project, and leadership and teamwork, and the stuff we had around us I guess. Um, let me see uh Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was Yeah, yeah go for that first. I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that, but y you go for it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Oh there it is. Mm 'kay. Okay. Well yeah, I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good. I dunno like a six or something. What does anybody else think? Mm. Mm. Okay. I would say five or six. David? Okay. Oh yes sorry then, then I would say two or three. Yeah. Well it has the wee jog-dial but Mm. I'd go with three or four, maybe three. Yeah about three, okay. Well that's kind of But the yellow, I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour, couldn't it? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well yeah, I mean it's really basic looking isn't it? I mean I'd give that nearly a one. Five? That's really low. Well Yeah I suppose mm 'kay. Yep. Gonna have that on the side, aren't we, like there or something? Out of forty nine, I guess. 'S pretty good. Uh yeah. Twice that, about thirty one. So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine, seventy percent yeah. It's pretty good. Okay. Nobody saw it, honestly. Is that you all have all finished, or Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Okay, great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I? I don't know what your instructions have been. Okay, uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes, because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great. Cool. Um right, uh well next up then, because we've done finance, is the project evaluation. Oh right, okay. Right, okay. Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points, my four points, sorry, forgotten that. You got a different uh Oh yeah, they're good aren't they, yeah. Right okay, um yeah here we are. Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically. Um do you wanna start Andrew? I don't know, just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing? But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. I think it means like you know Yeah. Room. Oh yeah. Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay uh do you know what, actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it, I think. Yeah. So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or Yeah, but actual environment? Okay. Okay. Very good. Um what about leadership? I don't know if that means like, if I did a good job or something. I don't really know. From like your personal coach person and stuff like that, do you think maybe? Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, okay. So you think maybe a little too controlling or Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, uh what about teamwork? Yeah. Okay. Mm. Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you? Oh that's alright. I was wondering if that got there okay. Okay, um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue, saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting, you know just like quick questions, quick thoughts, whatever, it probably would be bit easier. Oh right, okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right, uh anything else to say on teamwork at all? Okay, um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard, the digital pens, the projector, stuff like that? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful, anything was pretty un f unsupportive? Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And point at? Yeah. Yeah. Ah. So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Okay uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What about the digital pens, did you find them easy enough to use? Yeah. Clunky, okay. Um Yeah. I know, I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff, didn't click note on one, then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page, but then did click note, and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something, but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting? Okay. I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually, like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that, um I don't know about anybody else. Um what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found. Um I don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all? Mm. Yeah if we just had uh Mm-hmm. Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do, and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design, I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah. I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room, and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down, just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings, but There you go. Um so in closing, I haven't got my five minutes to go. Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go. Wonderful. Okay um are the costs within the budget, yes they are. And is the project evaluated, yes it is. So now celebrate. Well apparently now I write the final report. What are you guys doing now? You dunno? That is lovely. So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything? Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer, right okay. I think it's quite nice. Oh no, that's cool, it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber, I think that would have been nice. Ah well, maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money. Play-Doh s Really? Yeah. Did they? Okay. Play-Doh. Yeah, it smells funny doesn't it. Um Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be, yeah. Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Tangible. Okay uh Mm. I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss. That that's about it really. Just sit still I guess for a little while. Um Well I dunno. Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now. Yeah, yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so.\nUh-oh. This is it? Um, there are a few changes we've made. Um, well look at the expense sheet, and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside, so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen, um just a a very very basic one, very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button. Uh, apart from that, it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time. You know, just like right inside there. Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand. Well I'm We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button. Um But um this button um, because it's red it's sort of very prominent, we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal. Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial. I don't know. Didn't put five centimetres. Um. Something by there. Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons. Um, were gonna have the volume control here, but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume. Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast, colour and Um yeah. Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions, um we didn't actually go through and specify the Uh what can a T_V_ do? Um. the the balance hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing. Um we have um got some push buttons as well. 'Kay. So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber. I'm not sure if that counts but You can see we're we're all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved, just fill in those bits. That is one. That's fair enough, yeah. That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons. I think there's just one button so handy. Yeah. You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat. Yeah it works, yeah. See, about that thick. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. I'm seeing five then. One's high-ish isn't it? Ah, okay so yeah, two or three. Eight three. Yeah. Yeah one. Yeah I think it's about five. Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be I think I'd probably increase the cost. We've only got like what, ten cents left so Yeah. My leg. Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. Uh, reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, that would've been a lot easier. Not just yet. Yeah. Oh they're a bit clunky. Good point. Yeah. Is this for the project or Oh yeah. Do we know what the other ones are? Oh wow. Hey yeah, I said Ninja Homer. Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells. I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds. Yeah it's not very tangible.\nMm 'kay. Where are they? Ah, right. Great. Right. Okay. Right. Right, 'kay. Okay. Mm-hmm, and what is this here? Okay so the number pad is 'Kay, great. Mm. Yep. Looks good. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. About nine in total. That sounds good. Yeah. Yep. That'd be good, in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually, so that would be that sounds like a really good size, if you see it there. Mm. Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours. Is these are these the colours that of production, or is this just what we had available? Right. Mm-hmm. How high is it? Yeah. Okay. Sure. Three and a half. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, probably colour or sharpness. Mm-hmm. Audio. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm. Or even clear. Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if We only have very sparse Two point three? Four point three no? And then where is the Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah we could just go with um Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. How about with embossing the logo, isn't that going to cost us some money? Yeah. That's a freebie. Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible? Sort of flat as possible. Yeah. Yeah that's what I was thinking, to Sure, okay. Yeah alright yeah fair enough. Okay, just thought I'd ask. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Two's not very high at all though. Maybe a bit higher? Yeah. Maybe closer to three even or two and a half. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into, but um just in in that we want this to be stylish, should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid, because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid, and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah. Sure, okay. Yeah, alright. Okay, sure. What about button shape? Square buttons? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Do you want me to d um Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last? Or Evaluation. Okay. Sure. Um, alright so the way this works, I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint, I'll try and do it as quick as possible. Um, this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay. What's that? I don't need the PowerPoint? Oh course, yeah that's true. Let me get that. A bit more. Okay, so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning, and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan, and uh so we can review that. Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going, does it? Yeah, okay great. Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board, so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it. Okay, so um So to sort of b bring together two things, sort of design goals and also the market research that we had, uh when we rate this, one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low, okay. So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this, so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement. Okay? So the first one uh, stylish look and feel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour, and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit. But What do you guys think? Okay. Okay let's go with five then. Fi oh uh just actually the opposite. The So it meant three, okay. Yeah, one is high. 'Kay Let's go with two point five then. Okay, um control high tech innovation. We had to remove Yeah, so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted, but jog-dial 's good. Okay, three? Okay, um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour, design. I shouldn't have said colour, but just Sorta. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah, could be. Yeah. Okay. Okay so we'll go two. Yeah? Okay, and um design is simple to use, simple in features. F f yeah f fairly basic, you guys think? Yeah, one? Okay. Um, soft and spongy, have we achieved that? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price. Five? That's Um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it? Was that an option? It would cost more than plastic. Okay, logo, we've got it in there, haven't we? Huh. And um it's within budget, yep. It is, isn't it? Okay, so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here? Yeah, out of forty nine with with zero being the highest. We are at uh two, seven, eight, ten, fifteen point five. So it's pretty good. Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal. Right? I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one, and then invert that, it's Oh right, about seventy, yeah seventy percent. Okay, good. That was just a little formality for us to go through. Yep, oh hundred pound pen. Sorry alright. No. Hmm. Yeah that's that's me. I did have one other um one other frame I thought, I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information, I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design, revisiting our original goals. It's not something I need to p push through, but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions, um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the, I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant, I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones, lime green, lemon. It's just discussion. I mean obviously we can just abandon this, it's fine. I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do. Um, yep so there. That's all. Um, I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet. Yeah. I will, yeah. Huh. Yep. I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that. It's really quick. To use. Sure, um so what is it you're asking of me now? Or sort of our work on setting this up. Yeah. Well, is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then. The the room uh is fairly institutional, but um the main thing is, I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion, you know, as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity, whereas in reality as we've gone through this, it's not really the centre point of creativity, it's more just a d debating Yeah, yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there, the room, it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave, and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then, you know. Oh, oh right right, oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard, digital pens, the room. No, of course, yeah. Sorry. Huh. Yeah. Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this, but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends, say fruit and vegetable colour scheme, but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours. So what do we do. We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. New creativity. Yep. Right. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction, encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think, just sort of acting as team leader. Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good. I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation, but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know, innovative thought with. In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within. And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member, so But it's not bad leadership, it's just sort of s fairly strong, you know. It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism, as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah, oh yeah, without without a doubt. Yeah maybe not co confining. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah. Um did, you wanna comment Craig? Yeah. Yeah. Fully agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, got the email. Yeah. Yeah, in it Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, exactly. Yeah, I mean if you Yeah, I mean sort of taking upon that idea, w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided, and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together, maybe that was a bit different, but um yeah, but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay, first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept, and we sit here together and do it, well that's what teamwork is. To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other, it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork. Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done. I'm not dissatisfied with it. Mm-hmm. I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time, but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been, maybe just in the way that we we use it, in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text. Um, and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that. I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product, but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks, we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds. It wasn't until we had this here, you know, like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like, now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book. But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare, whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush, for example, or whatever, I would've actually used it, um 'ca you know, just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, not quite. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And o on the topic of the technology, it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files. It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer. If there had been a fifth, that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other. So, that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea, well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Great. So it So now we I I don't know. Hmm. What did you call it? Huh, huh. Logo. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Fashion technology or something. Hmm, hmm, hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Huh. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's true, yeah. Hmm. And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they? Wow, hmm. Huh. Yep. Taste. Yeah. Mm-hmm, yep. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do we retreat to our, to continue our r reporting or what i\n\n\n\n@highlight\n\nWell this is the uh final detailed design meeting .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm , there are a few changes we've made .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .\n\n@highlight\n\nthe advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?\n\n@highlight\n\nThe L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .\n\n@highlight\n\nIf you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .\n\n@highlight\n\nThat's a number pad .\n\n@highlight\n\nWhere are we gonna have the slogan ?\n\n@highlight\n\njust like right inside there .\n\n@highlight\n\nWell we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo we're talking about ten centimetres .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .\n\n@highlight\n\nuh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .\n\n@highlight\n\nthis button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?\n\n@highlight\n\nbe about th three and a half .\n\n@highlight\n\nwhat else can you do ?\n\n@highlight\n\nUm you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .\n\n@highlight\n\nbut um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd what else do you do with the jog-dial ?\n\n@highlight\n\nUm you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .\n\n@highlight\n\nAudio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .\n\n@highlight\n\nleft-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all .\n\n@highlight\n\nfor this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?\n\n@highlight\n\nDo we have kinetic as well ?\n\n@highlight\n\nNo .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd that's because of cost restraints is it ?\n\n@highlight\n\nYep .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe need an advanced chip I think , yep .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo we want double-curved ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .\n\n@highlight\n\num and we wanted special colours didn't we ?\n\n@highlight\n\nFor the case itself , one colour .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt's one special colour .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe've got push buttons as well .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo we're w w quite far over .\n\n@highlight\n\nOkay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .\n\n@highlight\n\nsomething's gonna have to go .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm we're at sixteen point eight and The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .\n\n@highlight\n\nor the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .\n\n@highlight\n\nNo can do .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm so then these just become normal coloured buttons , And now we're under budget .\n\n@highlight\n\nsort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .\n\n@highlight\n\nwidth-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?\n\n@highlight\n\nHow how tall do you envisage it being ?\n\n@highlight\n\nAbout two centimetres , okay .\n\n@highlight\n\nMaybe closer to three even or two and a half .\n\n@highlight\n\nOkay we'll s we'll say two point five .\n\n@highlight\n\nbut um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , I think that's something that's very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .\n\n@highlight\n\nWhat about button shape ?\n\n@highlight\n\nSquare buttons ?\n\n@highlight\n\nYeah Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .\n\n@highlight\n\ndiscuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .\n\n@highlight\n\nI rate that pretty highly .\n\n@highlight\n\nOkay let's go with five then .\n\n@highlight\n\nFi oh uh just actually the opposite .\n\n@highlight\n\nLet's go with two point five then .\n\n@highlight\n\nhigh tech innovation .\n\n@highlight\n\nso we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial Yeah about three , okay .\n\n@highlight\n\nStyle reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .\n\n@highlight\n\nthe the yellow is more representative of the colour , Okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , so we'll go two .\n\n@highlight\n\nand um design is simple to use , simple in features .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean I'd give that nearly a one .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?\n\n@highlight\n\nWe've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .\n\n@highlight\n\nYeah I think it's about five .\n\n@highlight\n\nlogo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd um it's within budget , yep .\n\n@highlight\n\nout of forty nine with with zero being the highest .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo it's pretty good .\n\n@highlight\n\nI thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .\n\n@highlight\n\nUm well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?\n\n@highlight\n\nYeah , yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .\n\n@highlight\n\nBut I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .\n\n@highlight\n\nanswering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual The constraints do come in very fast .\n\n@highlight\n\nit's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .\n\n@highlight\n\nand and the time the time given also restricts In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think the interactions are very structured .\n\n@highlight\n\nSo you think maybe a little too controlling or Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .\n\n@highlight\n\nI don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .\n\n@highlight\n\nuh what about teamwork ?\n\n@highlight\n\nIf we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , maybe just in the way that we we use it

actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?\n\n@highlight\n\nOh they're a bit clunky .\n\n@highlight\n\nHaving to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , So I think the pen's good .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe only actually needed one computer .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .\n\n@highlight\n\nwell you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .\n\n@highlight\n\nI think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c And we have Ninja Homer .\n\n@highlight\n\nWell apparently now I write the final report .\n\n@highlight\n\nI'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .\n\n@highlight\n\nLike we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt becomes tangible .",
    "summary": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost. In maintaining the target cost, the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted, such as a kinetic battery, an LCD display, and various color options. The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, technological innovation, and spongy quality. The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process. The team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork.",

The information brought to the meeting included market trend research, available cosmetic features for the unit and a specific user interface proposal.  \n\n  The challenge during this meeting was to begin incorporating as many of the production goals as possible in one concept.  The decisions made were done in great haste as time was limited.  We settled on a design using an \"8\" shape, with a jog-dial for channel selection, a concealed audio control compartment, lemon-lime colour scheme and backlighting.  It was also decided that if possible, the unit would be kinetic powered.

A more relaxed environment (without headsets, etc) might have been more conducive to creativity.\n\nLeadership: personal coach, project manager, etc meant for a lot of structure – perhaps too much.\n\nTeam work: would have been easier if we could have communicated outside meetings.  Tools available to us didn’t really support collaboration.  The actual work involved was quite isolated.\n\nMeans: would have preferred to use the whiteboard more, and powerpoint less.  Too many presentations.  Digital pens are quite chunky but easy enough to use.  Computers provided distraction in meetings.  Play dough very useful."
