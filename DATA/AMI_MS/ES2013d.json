    "transcript": "I keep forgetting whether I've done this.. Yep. Ta-da. Right. Mm-hmm. Um well I don't have very much to add. Um the the case oops, that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype. The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic. We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two, but it can be either of those. We have the technology to do that. Um and as for the the actual components um, uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture. We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need. Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end, it's the stalk of the banana, or it's just the thing at the end of this version. Um so that's for material. Colour, well uh Steph's the expert on colour. Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that. Yeah, I think that's all we've got to say really. A banana. Would you care to examine the prototypes, see how they feel in the hand? Yes, that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it. And it was partly we thought the design looked better, but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place. Hmm. And it's a very simple design, there's not a lot to wrong, the components are cheap to make. Mm-hmm. Yes, a plain, simple, clean design. Well we have got s trendy further down, but Elegant, I don't know if I'd call them elegant. Stylish, yeah. Yeah, I'd I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept. I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative. Very. Yeah. We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy. I think yeah. Yeah. No. So that's false. No. Yeah, I think they're different, aren't they? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop. We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there. I'd put it at one I think, but I dunno, what do you Yeah, true, it might be the yeah, yeah, true. True. Yeah, that's a good point. Right. Yeah. That was the crank, wind-up crank on the side. Just one. Uh uh yeah, I think we can do it all with simple Just checking that. Yeah, simple, 'cause we've just got push buttons, so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest. Yep. Yeah, that that one is single curve, isn't it? Um do we have I I think you it means you reverse the curve. Yeah. Yeah, I do I don't think we need that for either of them, you can do a banana in single curve, yeah. Yeah, can we do some what ifs, 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself, but it depends on the cost, I guess. Yes. Yep. Do we need to say how many buttons, or or d is it just one? 'Kay. Uh they'll be rubber, yep. Actually, does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material? 'Cause I think they can be plastic. Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons, because we haven't got a double curved case. It's just one, isn't it? What, we're in. More profit. Do you do you need to double click on that to open it? Yeah, yeah, the Play-Doh was best, I thought. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, I think we're a good team actually. I'm not sure all the wires are really great though. I thought so. Yes. Yes. Oh hang on, we haven't heard. Mm-hmm. Absolutely, and it's kept us within budget. And then we get the product launch party. Product launch party? Absolutely.\nRed. Agenda three. Mm. I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role. It's really kind of a Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Yeah. But it's also like texting, you don't Yeah. It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different. You know, I I d I have several four remotes, and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know, this is really identifiable. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, okay. Um shall I take your uh power? Oh. Okay. This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department. So, this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise. So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard, and I've made a list of criteria to look at, and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing, but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false, going over these different criteria, so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board. Okay. So um fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, buttons, excess buttons, good buttons, ugly, sellable, and other. And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms, because these are things that um have been brought up, some of them seem rather close, like they overlap. Mm, yeah, price. We'll put price up at the top. Um Okay, so Did you say? Uh okay, so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I yeah, so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect. Yeah. Elegant. Yeah, no these aren't the exact terms that the um Yeah. Elegant. We're gon let's use elegant, although the the the people, the word on the street is is Yeah. N that um yeah uh the uh is fancy. So let's let's take it to the next level. Well okay, so in terms of elegant, fancy. we'll call it E_F_ um, do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow? Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As a banana. I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana. And of the two I really like I m I like the banana, but I I do like the chunk. No, but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them. Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both? Okay. So we say true. Um technologically innovative. Yeah. So we'll say we'll say uh false. Easy to use. One, is that inappropriate? Okay. Oh, pardon me. Um trendy, s and I say specifically spongy fruity. Okay. Okay, so two? Um are there excess buttons? That is false. Um good, well designed buttons, intuitive buttons. True. Ugly. People don't respond well to ugly. Sellable, uh quirky, you know, something people like oh, yeah. Yeah, I do too. Oh yeah. And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving? With the Yeah, with the energy. It is going to be kinetic? Yeah, we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro. Uh so yes. Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage. Anything else? Including price, do you have any idea about price or other features? Okay. So true one or should I go to two or three? Okay. Um other? Anything else you guys can thing of? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true, so that 'cause I have to do an average. And then um excess buttons. Exactly. Wow we're doing really well. Yeah, be you know, so it doesn't ruin the polarity. Mm-hmm. Or L_C_D_. Yeah. Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features. If not I'll average those. Okay. Mm. So Um okay, how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here. Thank you for everyone's help with that. One, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah. Sure. Yes. Yeah. Yep. I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes. I I only speak for myself though. Yes. I can give you a number, um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight, so it means w you know, I can I can spell it out. There were six true or ones, four um pardon me, two s almost true or close to true, so that was four points, and then uh one false, seven points, so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two. I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place. To maintain old technology, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Nice. So we might have to wait. Yeah. Um I one thing I want to do is oh, I think the meeting's done. Yeah. Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files, because I don't think everything is saved. The right files. Final meeting market\nYes. Alright. Well. Yeah, well you see, each made one, we didn't have enough yellow dough. This is the one that I made. It is uh curved, easy to hold, hand-held, nice and small with big easy buttons. This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus. Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television. I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television. Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that, but I'm sure it will work. Uh this is on off switch, 'cause I think we do need that, and I think it gives it a nice balance. And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there. Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up, down, left and right in the different menus. Uh position, I presume that just means right right on it, easy to see. The main feature of it is just a simple design, simple, lack of uh buttons all over the place. Right? Form curved, kind of smooth, hand-held, makes it feel nice to hold. Uh material, I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit, but I think we have two different options, because we did make a another one, which wa uh is in the shape of banana, it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana, which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design. Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. So like uh well, I dunno, what's it like? I guess like an existing remote control, but molded and smooth. Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one or mix and match, just we were gonna see what you thought, the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. So we have the two options we can follow, either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber, depending on cost restraints. And what we well, what conclusion we reach when we discuss it. Uh material yeah, that's what I have to say about material. Can I scroll down on there and see what else Well colour, I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons, because that's the company colours, but if anybody's got any other suggestions, I'm quite willing to consider them as well. So, it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah, maybe, Kate, you better say what you think about them. I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped. This one has n banana, yeah. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, but because it's round and molded, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, it's more like yeah, you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one, which I quite like that sort of image. 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and Hold them, you see, you know. Curvature, is it to your liking? If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all. Yeah. Breaking, oh right. Well you see, that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it, because then it'd just be rigid. Yeah, we really like we really like that design, I mean it looks just like a logo, that arrangement of the keys. Like a c like a compass point, you know, just up, down, left and right, and we think we could make that quite a good feature. And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel, but better. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I mean it that's what it makes me think of, mobile phones, I was try I was thinking, moving your thumb like this, what does that remind me of? It's texting. Hmm. Yeah. I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of, you know, text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen, but we do definitely think that it's a viable option. Uh yeah, we're finished. Yeah, what about price, is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials. Not that we actually know anything about it, but we can we can pretend. It depends what what you mean by fancy really, 'cause when I think of fancy, I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and, you know, like baroque curliness and which I'd call these quite uh minimalist, simple and plain, but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality, so in that respect it is quite fancy. I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy, I'd say maybe aesthetic. like stylish or aesthetic. Fancy. Did you just break the pen? Well d we'll just call it fancy then. Yeah, I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons, it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that, but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black. So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved, like a banana, but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, you know, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, so. So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now, is it. Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two. Yes. Oh yes. Well, maybe only a two or a three then, 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific Yeah, I don't really think that's gonna work, but No. No. Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think. It could be quite a good brand, like a good little object. Oh, we also need tho think about the energy. Is it the kinetic energy? If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy. Yeah, but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet, so we're not completely sure about that, but yeah. Yeah. I would say maybe a two, 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things. I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know, on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different, whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything, depending on what menu you're in. uh we need somebody to develop that. Yeah. Just putting no excess buttons. As for see if we're technologically innovative, I'd say it is quite innovative, because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons. I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market. Well, just kinetic then,. It's the wind-up. What does double curved mean, I don't understand. Oh no, we don't need that. No. Single-curved, I'd say. I I just wanna say plastic. It's just button. Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah, like the compass point one. Yeah, they could be plastic. Great. Yes. Yeah. And Play-Doh. Yeah well, 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying, well we quite want this, but imagine it rounder. So much better just to go and, you know, this is it, this is what we want. Yeah. Spongy. And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before, so. Good work as a design team, because we Oh yes. Yes. Yeah. And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology, which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works, so. Yeah. So we do count as I think excellent or one.. Bring on the ice sculptures. Yeah. That's what I said, ice sculptures. Is that the end of the meeting?\nUm almost, there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open. Ah-ha. Okay. We'll open that when the time is right. In the meantime Closing things down, okay. Let's see what this thing does. Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what? Ah, we came up together, we're good. Okay. Are we ready to start? Okay. It's now quarter of four. This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five. Okay. Right. Our agenda is, as before, for me to open the meeting, for us to go over the previous minutes, then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria. We then have a finance aspect, which is a spreadsheet, an Excel spreadsheet. And I know what you're all thinking of, oh my, um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in, including the production evaluation. So we're going to make a very fast track. Okay. Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing. So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to Where is it? I need to open mine. Not the agenda. No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes. That should be there, minutes. Yeah. Okay. Uh from meeting three, is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show, just use it as is? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it. Okay, um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting, we reviewed the previous minutes before that, um each of you made your presentations. Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations. The market trend of fruit and veg, mm spongy, uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy. Um we decided chip on print would be used. Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing, I think was the consensus, powered by kinetic energy. There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that. Um looking like a scroll, but it's really a push button technology, excuse my spelling um that was actually in use, that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production. Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management. Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo, a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us. Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time. Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one. And uh we closed as it ran out of time. Is that a fair presentation of what happened? Okay, back to this meeting. Um we're down to the prototype presentation. Over to you. Ooh, two. Ah. Uh-huh. 'Kay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh I see, the on-off's in the back. And then you can use your thumb. I could see this thing, unless it's reinforced, having a problem with the you know yeah. Hmm. Okay. The next item is evaluation. Uh if that's if you're finished. Oh sorry. Try again. Hmm. Well we will soon, unfortunately. Come on. No,. Elegant. Elegant. Mm. Yeah. The chunk. I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true. It's more true than false, about a two. Mm-hmm. Trendy. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Excess buttons. No. Better, more intuitive buttons, yes. No. I like it. Mm-hmm. Yes, the instinct says true. Yeah, that's not a cheap thing to get. Hmm. I think we're good. Okay. We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance. Okay. Yep. Right. Right. And as you can see it says the same thing, it had not lost itself, thank Goodness. And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me. Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device. Hand dynamo, battery, kinetic, solar cells. Okay. Yeah. Um what's a hand dynamo? Oh shoot, forget that. Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one. Okay. Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those. Okay, and we only need one of those. Okay, the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve. It looks like it single curve, 'cause of th the chunkiness. It's that's uh uh one. And that's uh that's the the one that goes like this. Right. No, single curve. Okay, case material supplements. Plastic, wood, rubber, titanium, special colour. We had the special colour. And did we say plastic? Yeah. Okay. We'll come back, if we can, to the rubber being added at the moment, that's where we are. Interface button push button interface. That's what we're using, isn't it? Whoops, don't want that, not yet. Um No, it just says push button interface. Button supplements, they'll be in a special colour of black. And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of, rubber? So we need one of them. And are they any special form? 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top. Oh. Okay. Um let's put that rubber in then, of the case material supplement. Uh we only need one of them. Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed. We're in. That's us. Okay, I'm going to save this into our desktop, project documents. Okay. As our project document bit. Yeah. There we are. That's the only Excel document that will be in there, so it's there for all of us. Okay, so, are they under twelve fifty? Yes, go to the project evaluation, next slide. Right. Um the project process, satisfaction with, for example, the room for creativity. Yeah, leadership, teamwork, means, of having whiteboard, the digital pens and all that kind of good things. Uh-huh. Okay. So, we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above. Um did we find any new ideas? So we actually worked well as a group. Right. Are the costs within the budget? Yes. Is the project evaluated? Yes. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Alright. And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary, I have a final report to present, um and then we're done. We done good, and we're finished in time. I believe that is the end of our meeting.

.\n\n@highlight\n\nmaybe only a two or a three then , we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but

excess buttons .\n\n@highlight\n\nJust putting no excess buttons .\n\n@highlight\n\nso it doesn't ruin the polarity .\n\n@highlight\n\nsee if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .\n\n@highlight\n\nlet me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features .\n\n@highlight\n\nIf not I'll average those .\n\n@highlight\n\nand the next big thing is the finance .\n\n@highlight\n\nand I'll uh figure out the average here .\n\n@highlight\n\nThank you for everyone's help with that .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .\n\n@highlight\n\nHand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .\n\n@highlight\n\njust kinetic then , .\n\n@highlight\n\nElectronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .\n\n@highlight\n\n'cause we've just got push buttons , and we only need one of those .\n\n@highlight\n\nthe case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve .\n\n@highlight\n\nIt looks like it single curve , What does double curved mean , I don't understand .\n\n@highlight\n\nI I think you it means you reverse the curve .\n\n@highlight\n\nyou can do a banana in single curve , case material supplements .\n\n@highlight\n\nPlastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .\n\n@highlight\n\nI just wanna say plastic .\n\n@highlight\n\nI mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , Okay .\n\n@highlight\n\nWe'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?\n\n@highlight\n\ndoes tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ?\n\n@highlight\n\nButton supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .\n\n@highlight\n\n'Cause I think they can be plastic .\n\n@highlight\n\nYeah .\n\n@highlight\n\nThey could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .\n\n@highlight\n\nMore profit .\n\n@highlight\n\ngo to the project evaluation , next slide .\n\n@highlight\n\nthe project

.\n\n@highlight\n\nmeans , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .\n\n@highlight\n\nYeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought .\n\n@highlight\n\n'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder .\n\n@highlight\n\nand we're satisfied with all the above .\n\n@highlight\n\nwe went over all those things Um did we find any new ideas ?\n\n@highlight\n\nI think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes .\n\n@highlight\n\nSpongy .\n\n@highlight\n\nAnd I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , Good work as a design team , I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .\n\n@highlight\n\nAre the costs within the budget ?\n\n@highlight\n\nOh yes .\n\n@highlight\n\nIs the project evaluated ?\n\n@highlight\n\nYes .\n\n@highlight\n\nI can give you a number , the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , There were six true or ones , two s almost true or close to true , and then uh one false , seven points , And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .\n\n@highlight\n\nI believe that is the end of our meeting .",
    "summary": "The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological innovation, ease of use, trendiness, and marketability. Overall, the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation. The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote. The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process, in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them, the ideas they came up with, and their teamwork.",
