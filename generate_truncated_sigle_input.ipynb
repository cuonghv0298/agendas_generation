The viewer used a highly directional flashlight to activate the four control functions, which turned the picture and sound on and off and changed channels by turning the tuner dial clockwise and counter-clockwise.\\nWhile it pioneered the concept of wireless TV remote control, the Flashmatic had some limitations. \\nIt was a simple device that had no protection circuits and, if the TV sat in an area in which the sun shone directly on it, the tuner might start rotating.\\nFindings\\nInfrared bulb\\nBulb  \\nSwitch  \\nEnergy source \\nWire\\nChip  \\nSubcomponent  \\nComponents\\nPersonal Preferences\\nInflatable (so that the size can vary according to user preferences)\\nColorful or Transparent\\nWaterproof\\nBeeps (loudly) or plays a tune\\nLong battery life\\nIS1008docs.Participant3.Interface_concept.ppt \\n------------ \\nInterface Concept\\nPresented by: Agnes,\\nUser Interface Designer\\nFunctionalities Used\\x0b\\nVisible\\nOn/off switch\\nVolume and channel control\\nMenu access button\\nErgonomic shape for easy holding\\nFlip screen\\nBattery life light\\nInvisible\\nAudio and tactile feedback of button presses\\nSingle word speech recognition \\nIS1008docs.Participant3.Interface_FinalDesign.ppt \\n------------ \\nInterface Concept\\nPresented by: Agnes\\nUser Interface Designer\\nSpecifying the case\\x0b\\ni.

Then we had a quick introduction to the project, with some confusion about what the goal of the project is. The marketing and industrial design reps were then asked to give overviews of their plans, or at least a timeframe for when the plans would be ready. Both agreed that it was too early to have concrete plans. The user interface designer was asked if they would be coordinating, and the answer was that no, they wouldn’t be but that they would still need to interact closely with both marketing and industrial design to determine and meet user requirements needs.
