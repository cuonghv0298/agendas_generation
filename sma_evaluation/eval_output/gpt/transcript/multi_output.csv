IS1006c.json,"How was lunch? Mm. Why? Mm-hmm. W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display? L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_. No, it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus. Okay, so let's try it, let's t Yeah, yeah, it's it's not gonna be a touch pad, uh just a display for giving you information. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No more questions. Mm yeah, yeah. But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice, L_C_ I'm an artist, sorry. So uh, that's not I hope that's not too much. Okay. Uh participant number three. Uh mm mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah. Uh so the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. So let's start with this. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button, I don't know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off? Or no? I can see nothing. So that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control. Yeah. Really? I thought you like it. Ah okay just press the button, please uh. Yeah, we will not use this. We will not use this. But instead of this I will devise That's our concept. And it's got just few buttons, quite low looking, and all this stuff we already we already discussed. And uh what will people say? They'll say it's perfect. Or what will say? Uh they will say it's splendid. And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it. And everyone's gonna be satisfied. I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours. Not the case. Yeah. Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels. Do you like it? That's why you don't have it. That's why, 'cause it's nasty. No. Um, I am here. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Okay, what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact, um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature, yeah. We can make it in fact. If if if the okay. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, so Uh-huh. So, be an option, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time. And it makes you different, you know? Anyone has their remote controls here? No? Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Could we integrate something into our remote control, something like light? That they can use it in darkness, like. Hand light, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. S well, let's go on maybe with the presentation. And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much? And uh I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. So just just just just think about it um. Thank you. Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart. Voice recognition is quite tough. I say don't use it, and the control just looks. 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it. Yeah, sure. Mm-hmm. Okay, thanks. What is spongy? Okay. Okay. So we have to uh for yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends? Well, we can make it smell like fruit. Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Could we make a titanium shape? I mean fruit-shaped. But Doub double-curved. Okay, okay. In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body. Well, okay w we'll see. Yeah We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look. Okay, okay. Alright, alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Thanks Don't be sarcastic. Mark. Uh Rama. Ah. Mm-hmm. What is a double-curved shape? Uh-huh. The cost. Mm like this? Mm-hmm. Speech L_C_D_. Seems not, it's either L_C_D_ or push-button. Ah. The L_C_D_ would The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean. Just uh for output, yeah. Yeah. I guess no um. So the batteries uh are going to be very light. Okay. So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically, instead of clapping why not just be ask. Mm-hmm. Okay. No, it's okay. Puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that. We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible. Anyway. Yeah. L_C_D_. L_S_D_ is something else, and it's quite nice as well. So, go on uh artist. Hmm. Let's change millenniums. doesn't make sense. This is very ugly. Oh no, too much concept. Ah. Ah, back today. Do you think it can come in several colours? Or did the Um but not the case. Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff, like Yeah, well they like uh something which is uh Mm yeah, okay, so that would be the option. I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone, but I don't use that but again, uh I might Yeah, bu but Mm-hmm. Kind of upgradable uh remote control. Wow, wow. Mm. Like a chameleon. Mm-hmm. Because uh I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature. My remote control is pink. Nobody else than me has a pink remote control. And that makes me special. I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that. Those who wanted to have it pink. No mm no. It might be optional, yeah. The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends. Although similar but have something just slightly better. Pink Mm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You always have your remote. Oh, you don't? Yeah. You don't have your remo Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod. It's a kind of remote control. Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere. It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control. White. Seems important. Mm glow in the dark, so Okay. Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah sure. Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing. Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition. I dunno. Don't touch the remote. But yeah. Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want. Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or Mm. Um Mm. Okay. So it could be smart in that way. But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have. S since it it knows who is using it, it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them, I dunno, somehow, I dunno, that might be expensive but that might also be a good sales pitch again. The remote that knows you. My turn? Okay, it's alright. Four, I think. Trend, yeah. No uh yes. Okay, so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control. So, next slide please. So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple. Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know, so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing, and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them, always, like a phone. We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired. Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends, they're inventing it, they're creating the trend. I hope I'm going to try to help you on that. This is more risky because you're not following the trend, you try to invent it, which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business. So anyway uh next slide please. Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to. The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy, it has to have a fancy look and feel. And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing. It has to be fancy. Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative, it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important, which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. So as you see uh it first have to be very nice, s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends, huh, mine has this and not yours. And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control. Next slide please. Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing. If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so. And I think of course uh i it applies to everything. That's the thing with trends. It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea. Fruit and vegetable. Think fruit and vegetable. And uh if we co we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy, yeah. Well this so so I think uh uh i When we were talking about rubber, I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess. Seems not, seems not. Yeah. So Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy, as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow. I mean And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like. So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and Okay that's all I have to say. These I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world, of course, as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well. No, it's not it's not this this is very general, yeah. But it seems that trends travel across things. The what we Sure. Yeah. We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside, so of course. This is your problem. This is not mine. Yeah, I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material. If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good. Okay? Yep. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thanks. Spongy. No, we don't have to, but seems it's the trend. Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend. So there's no Well, that's you t can try to convince us. Okay. that's a good idea, I Uh I think i yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't. It's fancy. Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important. Maybe you could explore the two option. Mm. Seems to be. If you have time. For creation. You can paint it afterward. No problem. We have a very large department of paint. You will do it. Yeah. The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are. Yeah. That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing. Yeah. Classical, we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel. Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control. So. Because the trend goes faster than the life of the So it's very Okay. We're done.
Ramaro. Yeah, participant two. Component. Yep. So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy, and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium, which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. And we can use some, moving kind of thing. So, as we discussed before, we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors. And we also want to look at our remote control, so. Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range, like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house. So uh we discussed an Excuse me. So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery. And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes. Like you can have two curves. Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic. So, we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive, since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost. Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and Yeah. Yeah. Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah. But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh. And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for S S Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology, so Uh l So uh it's like a Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter Ok Yeah, that can we we can consider, because like it won't take much money I guess, because Okay, yep. You have any further questions or? Yeah. Yeah, we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with uh good price. Yeah, that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five, six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent. If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so Yeah, if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something. Yep. Thank you. Yeah. Oh. We have uh some limitations. Three. So maybe you can use in the end and Uh Mm. Yeah. But it's uh But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly. So users have different I mean they have their own interests, colour interests and so So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro. Yeah. Yeah yeah yes. If they want like uh so that we can yeah. Yeah. Just they'll get few more things and few more colours. Lights, yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Mm. Yeah. Uh Mm. But those people will be really few, no? So like we can those Ah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah. Yeah, that Oh. Yeah. Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess, like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's Hmm. Four. Mm. Yeah kind of um maybe Yeah it Yeah. Yeah. We need to think about mm mm. Fruit. Even shape? More yeah. Yeah. Mm. So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people? Or it's This you you so did you Where? Oh. Oh, okay, mm-hmm. It's not from mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control. Mm. Yeah. Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah. yeah, yeah sponge, yeah yeah at least that's Yeah yeah that yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah, looking yeah fruit. These things can be easily incorporated. We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Look and feel de Hmm. Hmm. Mm sounds interesting. So, can we highlight the specific features of our yeah, so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables, that's we want to follow general trend. Yeah. So, do you think Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's So what about location and these things, people are really interesting on those features? Or they really like They more want these fancy features like Feature Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah. Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even design. So still we want to keep L_C_D_? Or Okay. Yeah, then we can yeah, yeah, that user friendly or Mm. Yeah. Yeah. and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah, because Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're done. Yep.
Okay, so now we are on the conceptual design meeting. Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting. Mm great. So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design, first Rama then Mark and then Sammy. Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes. So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept, so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case. And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements. And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing. It's So, let's go. First with Rama. Participant two. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, okay. Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light. Okay. You m titanium it's more uh Yes so mm Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh yeah so Okay, s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Okay, for the location. Hmm. Okay. So let's now go to the you don't have more question? Um mm thank you mm. Yeah. Yeah, but mm. Okay. Um yeah. Now let's talk about uh interface. Three. Which one? Okay. Mm. No. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Because apparently from your survey people like colours, no? Okay. So? Uh-huh, okay, so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, yeah. Okay. And thermodynamic also. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah. But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version, but Mm-hmm. Okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is Okay, so so i it's not uh a s base service it's a Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base. And you'll be different. Uh in the train uh, hello uh no. Want to change my neighbour. Mm. Mm-hmm. Iradium? Ah sorry. Mm. Okay. So mm Mm-hmm. Mm, that's a nice world. Okay. Mm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So it's yeah, Marketing Expert. Participant two? Four, sorry. Mm. Mm-hmm. S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea. Mm-hmm. Um sorry Mark. It seems to be Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. You're old-fashioned. Sorry. Okay. Mm you have questions? Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. No more question? Okay. So Mm-hmm. Okay, so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again. Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design, um Mark the user interface design, and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation. Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay. Mm-hmm um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction. Yeah you're right, you have to So you say s S do we agree on that? Yeah. We have to. No. Okay, that's a good idea. So titanium smell like fruit. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I I agree with uh this uh Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness. Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Mm. Yeah, yeah. Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-mm. Okay, so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two. Or or spongy an yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose. If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both. Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium. Yeah, do don't worry, you you you speak with mm mm. Okay. So explore a shape. Mm I think it's what we say, that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information. Not uh Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. So are we mm. Okay. So see you in thirty minutes.
@highlight
now we are on the conceptual design meeting .
@highlight
I will again do the secretary part the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case .
@highlight
And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements .

And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing .

@highlight
we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?
@highlight
it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .
@highlight
maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .
@highlight
the batteries uh are going to be very light .
@highlight
and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask .
@highlight
We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible .
@highlight
the concept of the interface .
@highlight
Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls .
@highlight
We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , maybe this button is power on and off ?
@highlight
that's our concept .
@highlight
It's called the millennium remote control .
@highlight
doesn't make sense .
@highlight
This is very ugly .
@highlight
too much concept .
@highlight
we will not use this .
@highlight
We will not use this .
@highlight
But instead of this I will devise That's our concept .
@highlight
And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .
@highlight
Do you think it can come in several colours ?
@highlight
I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .
@highlight
Um but not the case .
@highlight
Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , Because apparently from your survey people like colours , let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .
@highlight
so that would be the option But it would be expensive , no ?
@highlight
If you use colour L_C_D_ .
@highlight
if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .
@highlight
Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .
@highlight
you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .
@highlight
Because uh I think there are two kinds of people .
@highlight
Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .
@highlight
It might be optional , yeah .
@highlight
Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
@highlight
That they can use it in darkness , like .
@highlight
Hand light , And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?
@highlight
I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ?
@highlight
I just want to say it should be real smart .
@highlight
since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use So it could be smart in that way .
@highlight
it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that that might be expensive The remote that knows you .
@highlight
I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control .
@highlight
Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to .

The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel .

And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing .
@highlight
It has to be fancy .
@highlight
Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control .
@highlight
And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control .
@highlight
currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel And I think of course uh i it applies to everything .
@highlight
It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea .
@highlight
And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
@highlight
So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .
@highlight
Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow .
@highlight
I mean And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .
@highlight
these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ?
@highlight
we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .
@highlight
But it seems that trends travel across things .
@highlight
but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables fruit .
@highlight
These things can be easily incorporated .
@highlight
We can have t colours or this shape If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good .
@highlight
we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again .
@highlight
Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation .
@highlight
Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .
@highlight
um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .
@highlight
we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , we want to follow general trend .
@highlight
No , we don't have to , Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .
@highlight
are we confident enough on creating trends ?
@highlight
we can make it smell like fruit .
@highlight
what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ?
@highlight
Or they really like They more want these fancy features it has to be fancy Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .
@highlight
so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness .
@highlight
Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like we will try to explore these two options Maybe you could explore the two option .
@highlight
Could we make a titanium shape ?
@highlight
I mean fruit-shaped .
@highlight
at least like we can make banana Doub double-curved .
@highlight
Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .
@highlight
you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .
@highlight
Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .
@highlight
I think we have to choose .
@highlight
If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy still we want to keep L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
Or Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .
@highlight
The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .
@highlight
That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .
@highlight
and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .
@highlight
Because the trend goes faster than the life of the Yeah , we're done .","```

IS1008a.json,"Oops. That's as far as it goes. Do you also do marketing? And I'm Christine, and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer. But I'm not really one. What is the goal of the project? Um no, I I have not begun working on the design, and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, I thought we were designing a new monitor. Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor, and um I understood that that was the project goal. So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal. Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, and um that's about uh that's and I I read through the different steps, and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps. Uh for the industrial design? Um well, I would th think that depends on how much money you give us. Um because uh, you know, you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models. Well, you know um, I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal, and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own. So it would really would need to um something like the iPod would be good, seems to have caught on fairly well, so um d uh you know, I don't care what it does, just so it looks cool. Well, uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go. If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month. If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And when would you like that? Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough? Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan? Okay, I'll get back to you on that. Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? Thank you.
My name is Ed and I do accounting. E_D_. Mm. No. Accounting, yes. Marketing is uh, is me. Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product. We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. Uh for the moment not yet. Good question. No, this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. Certainly by the next meeting. I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do. We have to define exactly what our product is, from uh From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee, is that right? Remote controls, 'cause I had two different things. I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. So we're have to design something that is very user friendly. Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product, because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls, and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window. Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use, 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it. Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition, uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new, it has to be something that that draws people saying eh, I like this. Whether it works or not, they have to first say I like this, I like the design, and then it's gotta be simple to use. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do we already have a cost limit on this, th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for, how much it's gonna sell for, that's up that's up to us to decide, eh? Very good. Very good. No.
Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer. Um I was wondering Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Well, no, not exactly. I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that. So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her, so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work, and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in, but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Which will also feed into the marketing, because depending on what users want, depends on how you sell it, what tag lines you attach to it, how you try to make it more attractive to users. So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit. Um, and then I guess build the plan based on all of that, because I think you need to take all the factors into account. Yeah, of course. Yeah, we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around. Sure. No problem. So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah, that would be useful. Sure. Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
Hi guys uh good morning everybody here. And uh I want to introduce myself, uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here. And what you're uh drawing? Uh how you spell your name uh? E_D_ okay. And? So only accounting? Okay. And? Mm-hmm. Industrial designer. So who is uh marketing, nobody in the market It's you, okay. So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, and uh we have a long time, just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation. First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or Oh for the moment not yet, okay, but uh what's what's your uh do you have some project plan, something with you or Mm-hmm. Okay, so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan, okay, a discussion with uh By next meeting, okay that will be great. Uh Okay, so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project? Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed, okay, so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. Yes, so can you explain uh what exactly the product is? Oh I think uh, if I'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And uh what abo uh Christine, what about your uh the industrial design plan? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design? Yes. Okay. That's Yeah, but uh before we talk about uh the finance, okay, uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also. Mm-hmm. Okay, but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? Yeah, but uh I need something in the writing, so like uh what's your functional design, what's your technical design, and uh how many people you need for this project, and what's the time frame you're looking, okay, and what is the budget, maybe uh initial budget you're looking, okay, and uh how is going to the market, okay, so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan, okay, when are you going to introduce, okay, and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition, okay, so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you. Okay, and it's po B as soon as possible. Yes I think uh that would be good, because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do, and uh what cost is, okay, and what's the time frame and what's the project plan, because uh without any uh documentations, I cannot go to the management and say, so we are going to do this and we need this much money, okay, so then it's it's difficult for me to say, okay, that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you, initially, okay, then we can have the further discussion again. Yes, of course, if you need some help, uh so let me know. So, who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view, okay, to add in any documentation, or some technical point of view, so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine, okay, because you know what she is going to do it, okay, and you know how to sell it. Okay, because uh she is doing the design, but you are the core because you are in the marketing, okay, so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money, the finance, okay, tomorrow. So, what I prefer, okay, so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design, okay, and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan, okay, how we are going to do the your sales plan, okay, th Th That that's Yes, that's you have to decide, okay, so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself, okay, and come up with the cost, and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay. Then uh we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project, okay, how much is going to cost us, and how much we are going to benefit for the company. Okay, of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually. Okay, so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan, okay, including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. Okay, and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, okay, depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan, okay, so you let me know. Okay, I can coordinate, or maybe uh, you are my coordinator, am I right? Between uh all the coor Yeah. Th Christine, yeah. Which is Yes. Yeah, so basically you need to interact with Christine more, okay, for the user acceptability, okay, and the testing, okay, then you will Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. But what I request, okay, keep Ed in the loop, okay, in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting, because uh he should know what's happening. Yes. Okay and please please copy all the mails, okay, all the discussions to me, okay, so I need to submit to the management. So any questions for uh time being? Yes. Okay. To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed, okay, and how it's going to be work, and uh first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, so then we can discuss about uh further things. So, we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting. It's okay? Thanks for coming. Yes, I will. Yes. I'll copy, uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies, okay, share each other, okay, so you know everybody what's happening, okay?

ES2002b.json,"Mm yeah. Nope, we're all set. Which which is the clunky one, the one on left or on the right?.. Okay. No. I'll add it later, I guess the presentation. No. No. Um function F_ eight. Function, the blue button. Next to the control on the left. Yeah. You have to push it together. Yep. Nope. Try that again. Wait. Yep, there we go. Increase that 'cause we can't see the That's much better. There you go. Bouncing on top. Is installing a new remote control something that people Um, I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market, in terms of people. 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote, how much is that lo locally in pounds? Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote? Right. Um so maybe not the high end range, but maybe middle, middle up-ish. Kind of. You know how much? I dunno I guess you pay, what, ten ten quid for a remote? Like a simple replacement, right. I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get, would you how much would you pay? Yeah. Yep. I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology. Yeah. I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer, who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work. I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five, but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that. So these are people who are gadgety, right? People who are u growing up used to, you know in schools and in universities, when you go on to their working lives, people who would you know regular Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now, because um, based on what you've go y everybody's saying, right, you want something simple. You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use. Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use. Um, but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology, rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say, and then, you know, say speech recognition is good for this, speech recognition is not good for this. So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition, anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function, but at end of the day we don't look at the technology, but we look at the function first. Okay, sure. Sorry, do you mind passing me my notepad. Thanks. Cool, um. Okay. Um. Well this is just the working design um. Well this is just what how I would go about it. Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now, try to define what we're trying to get done. Um I think in a practical way, we kind of know what it is. We've used it, we're familiar with it, but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil, like Besides the basics, I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are. Has to change channels, has to change volume, but in like specifics, right, which one of the basics are you trying to target. Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics? Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic, so, you know, things that to start everything going. But I guess everybody does have some idea, so I don't think um there's a need for that. Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing, so I'll go into the diagram first. It just explains how the process goes through, from a from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better. Um okay, you need some power source. 'Kay, a battery or something, to keep it going. Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last. Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want. Like for example, voice recognition, right. That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone, you might need to power other things, so that's one perhaps constraint there. Um Th Okay, the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes, whatever. You know, and that um picks up an input from a user, um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device, and the device has to r you know, based on you push button A_, so I will do something with button A_. So maybe button A_ is the power button, okay. Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here. Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um. It's fairly general, um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking, like um voice recognition, right, um, if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power. So it's not really a constraint in that sense, but I mean these are functionally, you know, the base, what the technology has to do. Um so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are? I think that's more relevant to a discussion? Yeah, w I'm done. More or less. Yeah. Ps Oh, it's just putting the rest of it into words, but it's essentially the same thing. Um you have a transmitter, an input device, logic chip, you know, stuff like that. Um I guess this would be Yep. Um, these these aren't technology options in that sense. This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed. For example, if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition, right, then your user interface would be split, broken down into more components, right, which you have a microphone, the V_R_ and stuff like that. Uh Yep. Yep. So each component represents one function, but I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, um and the receiver, okay, and the power are things that you won't have to care about. Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it. Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example. Okay, um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing? Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to. Right. Yep. There might be one other problem with the transmission, um in particular right now, since we're talking about voice recognition. Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device, you ideally want them to hold it to them. I it you may not require that, but you know, um it's it's it's something very natural, I guess, you know, to hold it, to signal to the user, and push a button maybe to start s talking about it. Then you need to send the signal out, so because if you're using infra-red, the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair, and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here, it blocks it. So in that sense, there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process. Not so much further down. There's there's not much specific specific information, but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices. Because infra-red is something which everybody has. There's a there's Okay, from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity, and you add cost to it, um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component. You need a docking cradle, for example, for you to put it in to charge. Or you need to get the user to plug it in. Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller. But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries, like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month, then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know, we really need to care about. Um. Okay, I think Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories. One would be audio controls, one would be video controls, and the other one would be a device. Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially, but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view, from a person designing the device, but I think from a point of view of a person using the device, you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear, um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off. I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets, right, where we could throw things into, like if we want this feature, let's throw it into there, and then from there decide whether it's basic, or it's non-basic. I mean it might help with the visualisation. And it would actually help with the component build as well. Mm no, not really. Mm. Um things like on off. Because they don't have anything to do with what you see. I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value, you know, um so um And channel. Because the on off also goes, you know, like on off like power, not on off sound. Not on off video. Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_, but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound, say you wanna pick up the phone, there's a mute button, right, so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device. Device is basically anything which we can't categorise, right. We put it out. Yeah, anything to do with what you hear, right. You you put that into audio. And then video is anything that you can see. Um. Yep. Yep. Yep. Like random which we have no other place to put, but we need it somewhere there. Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind. It's easy to use, I think that's one thing that um and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed.
Could you plug me in? Okay. Thanks. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan? 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics. Sure. Right. Mm-hmm. M yeah, like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over. So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research. But anyway, um we might come to that later. Um clunky in what sense, like um h heavier? Larger? I see, so it's more just basic. Right, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Which was that? Up the numbers, or the up down? Yeah. Yeah. We don't? No? Yeah. Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? Is that right? Is that what we're we're doing? We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have? Yeah. Yep. Well, one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um, things like channel and volume um are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, um very just very sort of self-explanatory. Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls, you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed. Something like that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure. Can this can this pl reach? Can this plug come across? No. So why don't I just pick up and move then. Here, I'll just Why don't I just Mm er, can you go up behind me? Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now. Okay. Um. So I can I can say already, I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things. Yeah, yeah. Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing, but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine, because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely. Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been So how do I how do I get this up? Okay. Okay. Alright. So F_ eight? Oh, and F_ eight. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, I think that that's doing it now. Uh, again? Okay. Um, okay great. Okay. Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing. And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, 'kay what what are our options, what should we decide and do you know what I mean, so. Okay. Okay. Alright. That would be Okay. So um does that make sense? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities. 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through. So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs, that we start with the customer, and w you know, what they want and what are issues with with um existing products. Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics. Um and then, as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um Dunno. Okay. Um. So this is what I've found here, um a lot of this is new to me, so we'll just read through together. Um, users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. So they find them ugly. Most people find them ugly. Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well, we'll see later, the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control, such as voice recognition. Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second. Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls. So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology, they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them. So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations, you know, one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands. Um, frustrations. They get lost a lot, s as it came up in our last meeting. Um, takes time to learn how to use them. This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls, so d it doesn't just look like a big panel, kinda like when you you look at, you know, a new computer keyboard, or something that is quite explanatory. If you want audio, if you want visual, then you have those. Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for. Uh, no, that did not come up at all. Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things. I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition. Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control. So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it. Um. And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this, I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy. Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products, so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like. You know, they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics. Yeah. Yeah, so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this. So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology. You know, it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days, something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can, but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through. Yeah. Yeah. That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay, well how do we collectively move on with it. Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea, although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles, and then use that. But not let that confine us technologically. So Alright? Any um comments on all of that? That's uh Yeah. Okay. Where's the money, maybe. Yeah. And who watches T_V_. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. This this kinda touches on your comments there, David. These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature. Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is. Mostly focused around the twenty five age group. Sort of young professional, kind of. Mm-hmm Uh, yeah, it's the Yep. It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying, in terms of Okay. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But yeah. Yeah, sure. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If we can. Yeah. Right. Could it be an on off thing? Like if you want it on Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind. Um Not Yeah. And not losing. And also it helps in terms of people not losing this, you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch. like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they Right. Oh really, you've seen one before. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Sure. Sure. Yep. Right. And like on the means b Since we're on the topic of the technology, uh are there any like what are our options? Alright, what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it, or are there other thin Right. The basic principle of 'Kay. Right. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay. And um just a clarification before we finish this. Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment, so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment? Okay. Just to T_V_, okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's good. And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features, or are we gonna eliminate those? Okay. R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they, you know, w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that. I dunno if that'd be a problem. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Right. Yeah. 'Kay, okay. Like that. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm okay, great. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um yeah, just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up, shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed, where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of, okay, we're talking about this. Shall we do that, then? Okay, great. And and channel. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Colour, yeah. Sure. Sure. Okay. And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah. Sure, okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Great. Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us.
I'll go first. Alright um, can I st steal this from the back of your laptop? Uh so this is the technical functions design. Um Right to do the um the design I have I've had a look online, I've had a look at the homepage, which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products. Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting. Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room, so Um, having a look at the existing products, I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes, there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colours, very confusing, you don't know what you're doing. Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad. Um there's an example I'll show you at the end, um sh show you now. Uh here um the button there and there. This one's prog. Sorry. That one's perg and that one's prog, and it doesn't really tell you what it does. Um, not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example. Um it's a very simple one. It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one. Uh it looked a bit clunky. They're very big and not very much use for buttons. Um, and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions. There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button. Um, my own preferences, I prefer the the clunky one. Um it's very easy to use. Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls. Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, or something like tha from the bottom of it. So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences. Um not sure of how long we've got, uh Um, the clunky one is the one on the right. Um I think it's supposed to be the same size, but um it's got much fewer buttons. It's, you know, it's very spread out and kind of you know, I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size. got very few buttons on it and Um, do we have any functions that um we'd want on it? I mean so far I've got um on and off, um switch the channel up and down, and put the volume up and down. Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_. Okay. Um, you say that's a h a required one or a requested one? Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing, um Um, yeah. Um Uh, to start with um sort of a bit both, um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible. There's um on and off, um volume and channel, and skip to certain channels with the numbers. Do you want to switch places? Just just switch them. Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose. Um Well, did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition? Sort of the the older group. Uh f Yeah. I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing, so you end up yelling at the control for hours. Channel up. Um I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in. Um. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. Um on off, up and down channels, up and down volume and uh skip to a channel. Ta. Um I think we include mute, but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness. Yeah. Um just about the three buckets, um what would go in the the device functions one? Um
Is that alright now? Okay. Sorry? Okay, everybody all set to start the meeting? Okay, we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design. All ready to go? Okay. Um so hopefully you've all been working away, and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder. Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time. Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project, you know, cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements, um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is. Nobody uses teletext very much anymore, so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control. Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television, not the V_C_R_, D_V_D_ or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production, the time to market. So um, we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_. And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design. Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is. It might be yellow, because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere. Well that's the thing, I'm I'm not sure um uh th because on the the company website, uh what does it say Uh something Yeah, I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it, 'cause it's quite long. Um or yeah, just the idea, but I'm not sure. So that's something we can discuss as well. So those are the three things, just not to worry about teletext, uh only control the T_V_, and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company. Um so is everybody okay with any of that, or do you want me to recap at all? Right um, time for presentations then. Who would like to go first? Okay, cool. Oh yeah, of course, yeah. G go on ahead. Mm-hmm. Okay. Alright. Oop. Um. Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most. Just a couple of minutes anyway. Mm-hmm. Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now. Yeah. Looks kind of Yeah. Well I think it's a valid point. I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated, and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing. Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design, but yeah you don't want to lose out on, you know, what it does, so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open, I think that's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, and then actual numbers for channels as well, yeah. God, I wou I would say that's required, I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels, I mean would anybody disagree with that? Um, what else, uh So don't need to worry about teletext, don't need to worry about V_C_R_, uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about, you know like brightness and contrast? Mm. Yeah. I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice? Mm-hmm. Okay, right. Well, do you wanna maybe just, at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this. Um, so so far, just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Right okay. Um Mm-hmm yeah. Oka Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh well, just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no. Um, uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements, and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that, maybe like a mute button, that sort of thing. Any of you anything to add to that at all? No. Okay, right. Um okay, if we can move on to next presentation then please. Um Do you wanna Probably not, actually. Yeah. bit complicated. It'd be nice if everything was wireless, wouldn't it? Right. Oh, like overlap between what you said? Oh well, for all you know that that'll happen. Mm hard to know what where your role ends, yeah. Okay. Uh pr yeah, press function and F_ eight, yeah. Mm. Yeah, you wanna Oh oh here we go. There you go. Um Okay. Right. Can you um Right, okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Repetitive strain injury. Mm-hmm. Okay. So want something that looks good and is easy to use, big priorities. Okay. Mm. So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together, you know. That's I think it's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Well, um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience, our target market. Um, so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use, but has y is fairly powerful product, whatever, who do we really want to aim that at? I mean Yeah, who wou who would have the money to spend. Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine, well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at. But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly, I suppose, they're gonna actually go out and buy one. So, who do you think we're aiming this at? It's about sixteen, seventeen pounds, I think. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay Okay. Yeah, so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then? Yeah, okay. Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider? What what do you think, Craig? N yeah. I think we are gonna have to narrow it down, to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know, there needs to be some kind of selling point to it. So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals, uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition, it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that. So we could say that was our target. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, so fifteen to thirty five, look fairly young. You know, they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech. That that's that's a good point. Um okay, so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can. Okay. Why is that? Okay. Where you can activate it and deactivate it? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh okay, well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss, but this is this is how we're Yeah, exactly, yeah. Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well. Um. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Really? Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though? Mm. Course not. There you go. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Uh. Well, do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then? Are you are you all done? Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market, so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red, so we could stay with tha Mm-hmm Oh, yeah. Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. W Yeah. W Well well we've um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_, so that's what we should do for now I think. Something I was wondering about was the power. Um, is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries? I mean is that something we really want to go into, do you think, or should we just consider running on regular batteries? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so just stick to to regular Okay. Um, right. So basically the um I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start, was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at, and what exactly the product's gonna do. So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket? Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do. Do you wanna recap on that, Craig? Okay, right. Okay. Yeah, it's as optional functions. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, right. Um, okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now. Um next thing we're doing is having lunch. Whoohoo. Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage. Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder. Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway, um for uh our Industrial Designer, you're gonna be thinking about the components concept. Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface, and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching. Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well. So um I dunno, just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking. Um, do you wanna start with David. Anything else to say at all? No, okay. Andrew? Yeah, yeah I think that's definitely a good idea. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay. Okay, and then visual Okay, so brightness, contrast, things like that, and then just actual device things, like what channel you're watching, turning on an off, stuff like that. Okay, um Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um so yeah, I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good, because of who we're we're, you know, targeting this at. Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe. Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold, you know, things like that. Um, so I guess I guess that's it. That's the meeting over. Whoohoo.
@highlight
Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design .
@highlight
and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .
@highlight
Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time .
@highlight
Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is .
@highlight
so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control .
@highlight
Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else .
@highlight
I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
@highlight
So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ .
@highlight
And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .
@highlight
Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .
@highlight
It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .
@highlight
And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?
@highlight
uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .
@highlight
I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long .
@highlight
So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company .
@highlight
time for presentations then .
@highlight
so this is the technical functions design .
@highlight
to do the um the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing .
@highlight
Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad .
@highlight
here um the button there and there .
@highlight
That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does .
@highlight
Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example .
@highlight
Um it's a very simple one .
@highlight
It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one .
@highlight
Uh it looked a bit clunky .
@highlight
They're very big and not very much use for buttons .
@highlight
and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions .
@highlight
Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one .
@highlight
Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences .
@highlight
Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?.
@highlight
.
@highlight
Um , the clunky one is the one on the right .
@highlight
Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons .
@highlight
Well I think it's a valid point .
@highlight
I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , Um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ?
@highlight
I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .
@highlight
and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah .
@highlight
Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ?
@highlight
God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising .
@highlight
We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?
@highlight
um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible .
@highlight
Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .
@highlight
Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .
@highlight
Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .
@highlight
For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely .
@highlight
Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip .
@highlight
and then others that are concealed .
@highlight
and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things .
@highlight
what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been Mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah .
@highlight
Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing .
@highlight
And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and what kind of decisions we could take away from it So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , and what are issues with with um existing products .
@highlight
and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision So this is what I've found here , Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls .
@highlight
Most people find them ugly .
@highlight
Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .
@highlight
Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls .
@highlight
they tend to use the most simple controls if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy .
@highlight
And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands .
@highlight
They get lost a lot , Um , takes time to learn how to use them .
@highlight
and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for .
@highlight
uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition .
@highlight
Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control .
@highlight
if that's possible we might consider getting into it .
@highlight
I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .
@highlight
You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .
@highlight
So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know .
@highlight
my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it .
@highlight
Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience , our target market .
@highlight
Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?
@highlight
Where's the money , maybe .
@highlight
Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend .
@highlight
it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people .
@highlight
Um 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?
@highlight
is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ?
@highlight
Mostly focused around the twenty five age group .
@highlight
Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ?
@highlight
It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it .
@highlight
if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that .
@highlight
I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .
@highlight
So these are people who are gadgety , right ?
@highlight
So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech .
@highlight
so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple .
@highlight
Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .
@highlight
Could it be an on off thing ?
@highlight
but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .
@highlight
but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .
@highlight
um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind .
@highlight
is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well .
@highlight
And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .
@highlight
Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?
@highlight
I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .
@highlight
Well this is just the working design um .
@highlight
Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are .
@highlight
Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target .
@highlight
so I'll go into the diagram first .
@highlight
It just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .
@highlight
you need some power source .
@highlight
Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last .
@highlight
Like for example , voice recognition , right .
@highlight
That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , so that's one perhaps constraint there .
@highlight
Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like um voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power .
@highlight
maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ?
@highlight
Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ?
@highlight
Yeah , w I'm done .
@highlight
Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ?
@highlight
Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense .
@highlight
a basic principles and basic components that are needed .
@highlight
So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about .
@highlight
Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example .
@highlight
Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ?
@highlight
Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to .
@highlight
Right .
@highlight
Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .
@highlight
so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .
@highlight
Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , There's there's not much specific specific information , In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?
@highlight
or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?
@highlight
Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .
@highlight
Or you need to get the user to plug it in .
@highlight
Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .
@highlight
then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about .
@highlight
Okay , so just stick to to regular was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?
@highlight
Yeah , that's good .
@highlight
I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible .
@highlight
Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel .
@highlight
Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do .
@highlight
And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness .
@highlight
is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some Yeah , it's as optional functions .
@highlight
'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that .
@highlight
Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?
@highlight
Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories .
@highlight
One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device .
@highlight
um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .
@highlight
I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .
@highlight
Mm okay , great .
@highlight
um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept .
@highlight
Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage .
@highlight
and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching .
@highlight
Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well .
@highlight
shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this .
@highlight
Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea .
@highlight
Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right .
@highlight
so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi And then video is anything that you can see .
@highlight
Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe .

ES2003b.json,"Mm. Okay. Yeah, it's in the it's in the folder yeah. Mm. Okay, this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote. As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance, so press on. I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on. Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. Um to save you getting off your backside. Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set. Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls. And most of these functions are not going to be used, it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. Um With uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions. And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume. Um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or uh V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward, record, so forth. Um. My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most. So, something that's uh something that is more programmable, that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls, um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do. Um, this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers, you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified. And so it's taking taking the lead from that. Um. That's it. Mm. Mm. Mm. I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume, left and right for channels. Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing, um. And I think and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind. Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white. Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first, you know, oh colour's out, we'll have to replace it won't we. It does nothing extra. Mm. Mm. Mm. I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone, you could put um I mean there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel. You can pack all that onto was onto a single control. Um. But uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation. I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling. Um concern about our market. Um, if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. Um, you've got twenty different devices in your living room, you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. Um, if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room, um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else. I just think that uh possibly mm. Mm. Mm. Does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Just a thought. Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers, rather than the public. Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um Mm, yeah, I've seen them. Mm. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Mm. Mm yeah. Yeah, I think that's Yeah. For volume. Actually how Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons, the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button. I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. Or vice versa. And that's really irritating. The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, um, so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick, you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb. Oh. So so a small speaker you mean. Mm-hmm. Blue ones particularly. Plus that's a nice wee design touch. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Actually one one wee thought about that. Um, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that, save us the bother, then that's you know vast amounts of sales. Quite quickly. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button..
No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link. A well actually just there. Yeah. That's it. If you dump it in there. Your username. Okay. Excellent. Right. Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go. So. Functional design meeting. We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff. Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. Not a lot thankfully to say. We introduced ourselves, discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more, um mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, um and ergonomics of the remote control as well. Um it's come to my attention the following. Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues. Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. Um. Now. Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use. So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so. Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going. Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first, to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go. So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want. Yep. Sorry. Uh. Is yours the Oh sorry. Okay, right. Uh if you that's all right. If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Yep. Okay, yep. Mm-hmm. If you could uh sor if you could speed it up a bit, yeah. If you could uh speed it up a bit please, yeah. Sorry. Cool. Okay. Excellent. Right. Um. Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea. Um, you've got your presentation now, is it on the is it? Okay. Technical functions? No. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Right. Um, if we could hear from our Industrial engineer, or Designer. If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder, or project documents. If you save it in there we can open it up from here. Are you finding it okay or? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh. Yeah. Ah, don't worry about it at all mate. Okay. Well. Oh sorry, I'm I'm interrupting you. Are you is it yeah? Okay. Right. Um, right we can probably skip that for now. So, we've had some stuff put forward, um along with the new user requirements, um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far. Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, um and the ability to the cost, it seems like for uh an embedded system, this could cause us issues. Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice, I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate, but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements. Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. Um that's just my view right now, however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far, it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take, but it might be quite low? Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an um fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example, they usually incorporate they have the keypad, and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around. That could be one possibility. Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels We I would agree with you. Mm-hmm. That would be my feeling as well, I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface. Um now I mean I don't sorry, go for it. I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile. And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people. Um, if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose. But that does cover a very large section of the people out there. Um, I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. Which maybe doesn't get used as often, maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it. Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, it depends, I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined. So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control. So that literally anybody can come along, pick up the remote and still know what do do. And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ and who would normally use the unit. I dunno. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid, this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on. So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed, for now. So I can understand your point, and I would agree with you, but this is our design spec for now. 'Fraid to say. Um I would say so, yes, because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes, and that is a separate unit. Um I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now. And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that. Okay. Maybe we'll hear differently, but for now It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions, yes. Um There is that possibility, yes. B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert, that might be sales, who are not in this meeting. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote, which as you said you've done, in fact we've probably all done. Um, I don't know if it's a gimmick or not, but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle, it will beep and you tell you where it is. Um. Well the other option of course is that um the well I was going to say clapping, um Um digital telephones, uh for example, one unit has of course you have to have that base unit, somewhere where there's a button, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_. Something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit. And that could be something could um separate us a bit. And that way, because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_, again say what, it would be a small transmitter, um watch battery type scenario I would say, or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into. Yep. Yeah, it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there, so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well. So. To go on from here. Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. Before we leave this meeting, it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get, this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique. Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry, we're gonna go for a remote control obviously, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_. We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume, and Okay. Mm-hmm. Vol Volume selection okay, yep, the teletext we're gambling with, and we're gonna say it's dead, the way of the dodo So we well, sorry, we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_, and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? So we're having very very few buttons involved, but navigation around a menu for most things. Okay. Okay. Um Okay. So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea. Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Do you mind looking? The ability to locate it again. So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, just so that it says find me, and what, a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit, can maybe hide it in the base. Sorry? Some speaker, sorry, yeah. Um E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate th e the true fact, considering the cost of an L_E_D_, we could just incorporate it anyway. The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now. Um. So by the sounds of it, with what we're suggesting so far, your design um the user interface is still quite open, you could go for quite an interesting design. Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_, joystick, e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly. Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far, the feasibility of um small transmitter, um and such, maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power, or such. Ebenezer, um, Marketing Expert If, yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken, where of a joystick to control the very basic functions, and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile. I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame, but could be something we could maybe look into. Okay. Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward? Anything that they think has been missed out. Bit of a wide open question there of course. Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible. Right. Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating, um, transmitter getting the external power source, yep, that's quite true. Um, and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say. The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally, makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control, so that's good. Uses maybe gives us a new potential market. 'Kay. Oh, one thing that we've almost not talked about at all, my apologies for that, um, user interface, we also need to maybe get the slogan in here, um it's, I'm pointing at my laptop, what in God Real reaction, and such. So um Oh, sorry. My apologies. No it could well be, I've probably missed that. Um, I think that's l almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top. So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that. But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes? In fact we might like to put a slogan on, and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company. Rather than real reaction. Sounds good. And I'd say that that's us for now. Okay.
How did where did where did you get all your in information? Oh. Ah, okay. Yeah. Uh, I was still working on stuff, I hadn't got it finished. Um, alright. Click to save in where do I have to save it? Um, what I've done with it, I'm sorry. Shit. Um I'm just closing it now. where I've saved it. that's it there, yeah. Oh right. Uh, right I'm responsible for working design, uh, this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control. So we have the energy source, we have the user interface, this this is what I've seen. Uh the sender will push the button, the chip will respond, uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_. So uh uh, if you go to next slide, you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface. Do we need uh many buttons, or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not. Um,, or would that take too much power, would we need more um components in there to supply the power? Um, the joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that, um, there'd be more components to deal with that. Um, so uh we need to I dunno exactly what That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design, but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface. So, that'll be decided, I guess. Uh, and the next slide. Oh, yeah Um, if you go to the next slide then. I just used the it was a mess, uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there. Uh Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, and the user interface obviously contains everything. You have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player, the bulb will turn on to say it's on. Uh, so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs, would it be easier? Um, I dunno what we should decide on that. No, it's finished, yeah. Cost. Mm. L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on, or uh, interactive L_C_D_ or Do you think that people will get mixed up, like, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then, you know, trying to get everything working, would it be a bit confusing? Yeah. Yeah We're just saying volume. Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? Yep. I Yeah, think so. Light bulb as well, no? And a light bulb? No. To flash. No. Nah, you'd see it anyway, if you hear it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So I should just look at um the speaker, the speaker and an L_E_D_. And Yeah, and a transmitter. P Fashion. The slogan is yeah, the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics, isn't it? 'S also look cool.
Just put it on the deskt desktop. Project documents, yeah. What's your username? What's your username and password? Mm-hmm. Sorry. Okay. There we go. 'Kay. Sure. Um, sh would you like to I'll just do it from here. Um, try second one maybe. Try it, yeah maybe. Yeah. Okay. Oh, I thought I put in my last name, I guess not, but. Okay. Oh yeah, that'd be fine, that'd be great. Okay. Functional requirement by me Ebenezer. Okay, so um we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some uh open ended questions, just, what are your opinions on the remote control, got a lot of re responses, and we asked some very specific questions, and we got a lot of good feedback. Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. Okay. So we got some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. I often lose my remote control, the back of the couch, some place, and even if it's not lost permanently, it takes me a few minutes to find it. Most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently, and there were so many buttons, it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button, 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons, you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And if they do, not very often. Takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, they're just not great to use. We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls, people do not like remote controls. Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. Now don't get excited yet, I've got more to say on that. Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they they want it to be different, everybody has a white remote control with black buttons, and a red button and a green button, not everybody wants that. Finally, my opinion. The voice recognition thing is cool. And uh voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. It's a bit sketchy at some times, uh, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, you know you have, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, you know, how many, you can't have that many words. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. I'm pretty sure people would buy it. But after a while people may wanna return it, because if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time. Using the remote control, ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels, and that's for flickering through channels. So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of. See, you could there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, because there are no restrictions on physical size, or shape, it it could be as fancy as you want it to be, you know, it could be like a lollipop or something like that, something weird like that. As long as the voice recognition stuff works, that's that's fine. So we have the three birds, we have the design, that we have the the fancy bit, right, the voice recognition's fancy, it's cool, it's different, it's radical, so, and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, I think is a big question. Um, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user, but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait, are you willing to have a bad remote control. And uh what if you have visitors come round, they stay the night, they wanna use the T_V_, they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you. Um, how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that. Uh, will people return the remote control, I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, you know, so, do our audience have the money, but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button, it's not a practical. So. These are things I think we should consider. I think it's cool, I'm sorry? Sure. I'm about to end, yeah. I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations. So, yeah. There was uh a website, uh, right here. G I started making stuff up, then I got an email saying Mm. Well like if you go to one, uh whichever one you were working yeah, and you just click file save as. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm. I uh Mm-hmm. Mm. Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one, but I think we don't have a specific audience, you know, like what is our target audience, what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner. You know, you know what I'm saying, like, for whom is this intended? Everybody? Most people, yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure. I think that's fair yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Okay, specifically television. So the joystick is just for differentness. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's just, the way I figure it, twelve point five Euros per unit, we have to sell at least like three million or something like that, not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys, you know, like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it, then we have to sell a lot of remote controls. We just Is this gonna be enough to to sell? Yeah. I had one of those, and my brother, and my dad, could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally. The clapping one. To a television. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. I think so, yeah. But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most. Um, power is used like once per hour, channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour, that's by far the biggest one, and then teletext, is still here, that's like fourteen, and volume selection. No, yeah, okay okay. Yeah, um Mm-hmm. Um, I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that Yeah. Speaker yeah. W those little key-rings have both, so Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I can give you the frequency, what people what options people use most often, I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface, right. You want the stuff. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. Mm. Sure. 'Kay. Yeah. Transmitter.

we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting .

discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well .

@highlight
I'm about to end , yeah .
@highlight
this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote .
@highlight
the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles .
@highlight
Um Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set .
@highlight
Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice .
@highlight
On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls .
@highlight
it creates a rather user unfriendly interface .
@highlight
And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used .
@highlight
Um and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design .
@highlight
Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most .
@highlight
something that's uh something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want .
@highlight
um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do .
@highlight
I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control .
@highlight
So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that .
@highlight
you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , Um , I dunno what we should decide on that .
@highlight
I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control .
@highlight
However I've got a couple of worries about that .
@highlight
The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues .
@highlight
Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible .
@highlight
however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels .
@highlight
Do you think that people will get mixed up , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white .
@highlight
Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down .
@highlight
but I think we don't have a specific audience , like what is our target audience , I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile .
@highlight
Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose .
@highlight
I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality .
@highlight
Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined .
@highlight
we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control .
@highlight
if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation .
@highlight
I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation .
@highlight
you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them .
@highlight
this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ?
@highlight
I would say so , yes , I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now .
@highlight
Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public .
@highlight
However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is .
@highlight
I had one of those , because it it went off all the time accidentally .
@highlight
the other option of course is that um the The clapping one .
@highlight
Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has somewhere where there's a button , of course you have to have that base unit , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ .
@highlight
Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .
@highlight
again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , that might be something that we could look into .
@highlight
that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .
@highlight
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote .
@highlight
and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ .
@highlight
Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?
@highlight
We could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ?
@highlight
Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button .
@highlight
I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay .
@highlight
The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , Do Yeah , think so .
@highlight
So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , and what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , Light bulb as well , a small speaker you mean .
@highlight
th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway .
@highlight
you could go for quite an interesting design .
@highlight
something that can make it stand out slightly .
@highlight
Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .
@highlight
I should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an L_E_D_ .
@highlight
Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .
@highlight
um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top .
@highlight
But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ?
@highlight
and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company .

IS1007b.json,"So we come again for the the second meeting. Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one. And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control. And we have think I got a new project requirement. So I think uh teletext becomes outdated. So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet, and I think we don't need lighting adaptive, so the remote control should be only used for the the television. And of course we should have our image in the in the design. So, let's start with the the industrial designer.. Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want. Here. Oh okay. This one. Do you want to open Ah. Wow. This. You can i yeah. Ma Yeah we can change the b. Yeah. Um. It's mine. Participant one, no? Mm. Oh we have so let's move to to user interface design. Participant During the weekend. That's good. Mm-hmm. This are usual functionality. Tasks. And they are small. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ than the So we should have specific T_V_? Or? We can use this. Yeah, we don't Yeah, I think so. J j just the remote control. Mm. Yeah, we. Yeah. Speech recognition. Keep the navigation but. So you are Mm. How the this remote? Yeah, of course small. Participant four. So Harry. Mm-hmm. But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility. Yeah. It Yeah. But is it useful or not u I don't know. There is in the Mm. I think i If it's necessary can you can do that. We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem. What about lighting adaptive options? According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that. Yeah. Mm. So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes. Mm-mm. So any things to to discuss? Or any suggestions? Expensive. Price. I think we we can we is the. Yeah. So you have to anticipate the the future?. In future. Okay. So let's go for the the lunch break, and we will meet after.
Just go to explorer. Or open. Participant two. Open uh. Slide show, view slide show,. One is a communication. Gateway arrays. It's a field programmable gateway arrays. Yeah. Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one? And the second one is for the software. Yeah to run th to make it run. That's it. No. Okay, and how about the battery power? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared? Into the more compact and uh okay,. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always. People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out. We just make a small charger and put it Bu Our remote, we do not want to make it P_D_A_. G Yeah, not the T_V_s. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Oh, but you have a catch there, um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then. Uh-huh huh huh huh. Mm-hmm hmm hmm. But Yeah then yeah that's right. Mm hmm hmm. Okay. Okay. too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it. Yeah, that's. just give it a name and we call him. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Okay, after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface, I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here. And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested, then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines, and the users send the feedbacks, and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is. Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. We just have the it's not going to take much space also. It's going to be very slim. And next one was the size of the remote control. It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive, so this is an important criteria here is I mean we have to look for a trade-off. The features and the cost. Little bit more if it's with extra features. Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's right. I mean, for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast. So, I think this should be a good idea, to put this features. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. Mm, I think Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting, but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. I mean I mean yeah, it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not. I think I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing. The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost. And the lighting adaptation and the teletext. And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions. If you are watching an foreign movie, you get subtitles sometimes. And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French. And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German. So, the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages. That should be a good uh point. We already have some. Yeah, that's right. Yeah,. Okay, thank you.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, alright. So uh Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here. Participant two. Yeah. Uh open. Right, so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television. So uh can you go one page down, please. So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do. So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use. Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like. And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that. And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that. Okay so can you go down uh So, wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the. Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication. And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components, uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set. The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well, putting things together, um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set. And, that's it. I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t It's field programmable uh something array. Yeah. Well, uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want. And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices. No. Well, th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send. Yeah. Yeah. Alright and that's it for the working design. So if you have any questions? Uh no no no no, I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t. Yeah, yeah. And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run, so Yeah. It's a good idea. Yeah. That's a good idea. Also, but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control. S okay, so charger for is the. Yeah. Of course. So we have to t We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too. I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because Yes, that's a good idea, I think. We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well, f four five buttons, it's sufficient. It's easy to build, it does not consume much power. Well, then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can Yeah. Maybe you. but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could Well, not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right, left, up, down, well, the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or So, we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that. But we'll see. Okay, so uh next presentation Mm. Well I I think it will be a, yes, a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts Yeah. And this can allow to choose the the program, for instance without uh adding uh buttons so it's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, s s speech is a important extra feature I think Well, uh Well, we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control, so I well it will be alright. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think it's a bit complex too For our next product, our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light. Function. Yeah, but well what about the the new project's requirement? I I I think we should give up with teletext, no? Yes. Well, so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television. Because if Yeah, but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So if we already have it in our remote control Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, to desi well, not not to implement it, but to well, to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah, in an in an easy manner, if is possible. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So Okay, thank you.
Mm-hmm. Okay. Because it's open you mean. F_ five. Did you draw it? This. What is the other chip for? The one on top. For men. To the in Okay. Mm. What is F_P_G_A_? So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth? Yeah. Programme it. Okay. Yeah. Uh So this are the they have to work together? Or? Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay. Is the is the software par alri okay. Okay, okay. So you can control if you want, right? Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Uh mm. Y yeah, yeah. Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth, if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to, right? I dunno. So is mine. Oh. Yeah, this your Yeah. So you can open uh three. Yeah. So So I'm working on the technical functions design. can you show the next slide. So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have. So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah. I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set. For example switch on, switch off, switch the next channel and so on and so on. So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ours is a bit uh different. So these are two example. One is from the other one is from, yeah, uh engineering centr yeah. This is the most competing prototypes I've found. But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah. O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy. So you so you move to the next the next one. Yeah, so I talk about the problem. And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick, so we don't want that. So I propose the easy to use uh prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller, right? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_. Yeah, all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the Yeah. Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_, any conventional T_V_ sets? Mm. Okay. N yeah, that's all. The next one? So I come up with a simple design, just keep the v navigation buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay, that's all. Mm. Mm. No, because you choose by channel, so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from. If you go by channel, you don't have to do that. Ah. Ah, a big jump. A mouse or Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh it's gonna be small. Yeah. So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device. I dunno how bu And responds to you, and I- mm. But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But Mm. Yeah. I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, yeah, extra features. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. What is the teletext? Mm. It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller. So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that? Or it's it's done via this remote controller? It's very complex. Mm. Yeah, then we can conclude that. Yeah. Yeah, but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm. Using the T_V_ to access the internet? Or what? I didn't quite understand Yeah, okay. Yeah. The future demand, market demand. The functionality in the future. Alright. Yeah. Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital, right. All the programmes, everything will be in digital than analog. Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change. Okay. Thank you.

Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one .

@highlight
I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t What is F_P_G_A_ ?
@highlight
It's a field programmable gateway arrays .
@highlight
So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ?

Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want .
@highlight
And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .
@highlight
So this are the they have to work together ?
@highlight
Or ?
@highlight
Do they have to work together or two separate choice Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .
@highlight
Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ?
@highlight
And the second one is for the software .
@highlight
Okay , and how about the battery power ?
@highlight
Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?
@highlight
I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so Mm .
@highlight
You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .
@highlight
It's a good idea .
@highlight
Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always .
@highlight
People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .
@highlight
We just make a small charger Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?
@highlight
we do not want to make it P_D_A_ .
@highlight
Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control .
@highlight
So I'm working on the technical functions design .
@highlight
So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .
@highlight
So so I found on a webs on the internet and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .
@highlight
For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .
@highlight
So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors This are usual functionality .
@highlight
Ours is a bit uh different .
@highlight
So these are two example .
@highlight
One is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah .
@highlight
This is the most competing prototypes I've found .
@highlight
But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons And they are small .
@highlight
O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy .
@highlight
So you so you move to the next the next one .
@highlight
And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that .
@highlight
So I propose the easy to use uh prototype .
@highlight
You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing .
@highlight
From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ?
@highlight
And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ .
@highlight
What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the So we should have specific T_V_ ?
@highlight
We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too .
@highlight
Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay .
@highlight
I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .
@highlight
Yes , that's a good idea , I think .
@highlight
We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient .
@highlight
It's easy to build , it does not consume much power .
@highlight
Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .
@highlight
Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel No , because you choose by channel , so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .
@highlight
but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .

Uh it's gonna be small .
@highlight
So it'll beep if you wanna find it too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .
@highlight
you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .
@highlight
just give it a name and we call him .
@highlight
And responds to you , and Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here .
@highlight
Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem .
@highlight
I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .
@highlight
And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons It's going to be very slim .
@highlight
it's not going to take much space also .
@highlight
It has to be of course a very slim and small one .
@highlight
And next one was the size of the remote control .
@highlight
And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , I mean we have to look for a trade-off .
@highlight
The features and the cost .
@highlight
I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost .
@highlight
Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , Little bit more if it's with extra features .
@highlight
Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes .
@highlight
but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .
@highlight
And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .
@highlight
we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so What about lighting adaptive options ?
@highlight
Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .
@highlight
According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that .
@highlight
but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project .
@highlight
So any things to to discuss ?
@highlight
I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing .
@highlight
The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost .
@highlight
And the lighting adaptation and the teletext .
@highlight
And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .
@highlight
If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes .
@highlight
And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French .
@highlight
And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German .
@highlight
So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .
@highlight
Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ?
@highlight
I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?
@highlight
Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television .
@highlight
Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .
@highlight
So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years .
@highlight
So you have to anticipate the the future ?
@highlight
well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right .
@highlight
Okay .
@highlight
So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after .","```

IS1008d.json,"Welcome back. Welcome back everybody. So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting. And uh opening and uh P_M_s of the meet minutes, uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes. Yes and uh evaluation criteria. The finance, it's uh from my side, from the management, and uh production evaluation. Then uh closing. So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further, okay, so Okay, let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype. So I handle to So shall I go to sorry. Yep. S Okay, let's go to A_M_I_. So in two or three or Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. I think the microphone is on on the top, uh on the middle, the under the flip. So that will be the safe, so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to Yes. Uh it's it's Yeah, but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk, okay, so then you can speak then you can close it. But if you put it on the on the flip, okay, then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible, 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised. Yeah, the sides maybe is good. So That's good idea. Yes. So it's maybe good idea. Yes. Yeah. So it's maybe good idea. S s Okay. S I'm fine, I'm satisfi I'm satisfied. Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy, but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight. Yes. Yep. That's your uh prototype model? Okay, that's good, thank you very much. So any comments or uh Okay. Yes, that uh So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria, I think uh that will be good, so then let's come to the finance uh, I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget. So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells. Uh it's optional, somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print, that's what uh we were talking about that. So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker, then uh we have the wood material, then special colour and push button. So it's uh actually, our budget was uh twelve point five Euro, but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro, so we are under uh below the budget, okay, so still we are saving some money. I think it's a good figure. Than thank you. So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing, for the sales, okay, and uh It's not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, so still uh we have twelve point five Euro. Yes. Yeah, but Yes. Yep. Yes. This we are talking about one unit, okay, so when it go into the quantity, okay, and the cost will come down. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. But anyhow, still we are under control, okay, so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get uh the production cost less, okay, so then we can save some money, okay, to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions, whatever, okay, so that uh I will look after. I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down. Yes. You're in four? TrendWatch. Okay. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes. Yep. Of course. Yep. Yep. Yes. Yes. To the agents. Yes. Or eBay, or Yes. Yeah, that's a good idea. To impro more profit and uh Yeah, yes. Yeah. We can. I don't think that's uh not possible, it's uh okay then, l uh let's wait for the production, okay, then uh you can evaluate the product, so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real. T Oh but Yes it's it's very quick, of course. It will uh come back in two weeks, okay, it will be ready in two weeks. For evaluation, okay. Yes, the prototype uh prototype product evaluation. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks. Yeah. Yeah, because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory, okay, so we can give it a product evalua Yes, yes. So we'll do it in the other place, and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time. Or uh Okay, so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation, okay, then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team, okay, uh from the management, then we can launch in the market. Hm? S Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss? Okay, so then uh Okay uh, let's take like this. Let's proceed with this model, okay, for the for the marketing direction, okay. So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. Okay? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can uh go for the second generation. Okay. There's no end, there's not limit. Every every custom Okay. Well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. Yeah, so that's the reason you are here for uh the design, okay, I hope you made a good design. Yeah, but uh see, we ought to take a few considerations, okay, one is the price consideration, one is future consideration, okay, like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli, okay, so i it's a depends on the individual taste, you know, so we have we have to balance somewhere. Yes. Yeah. The sports time. Football. Football. Yes. Yes. Yes. Research. Yep. Yes. Yes, the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that, okay. Sure, sure, yes.. Yeah. That's the reason Ed is here. I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value. Yes. We are behind the scene and he is the front screen, so. He's on the big screen. Okay, so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated, okay, so that will uh come soon. Okay for uh but our time being, so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate. So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party. 'S good. Thank you. Thank you again for all. And see you in the evening for drinks.
I'm sorry to be late. Agnes, yes. Uh thank you, so you did a PowerPoint presentation, good for you. Um and uh I could Yeah the d We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed. That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um Yes, okay. Uh-huh. No, I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board. Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand. Mm-hmm. Yeah, y better you pass it around with a napkin. It's um It's um You need to work on the weight a little bit. We're glad you're satisfied. Mm-hmm. Yes, great I I'm surprised. Congratulations. Oh, okay. It's gonna cost a long way to c you know, cost a lot of money to market it, is it? Thirty. Yeah. So that means we can put the uh the L_C_D_ in, yeah. Although customisation, because this is being done, you know, the on on-order basis, it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh the circuit board will b you're right, would be in producing quantity, but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro. That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow, that's really outstanding. Is this the same one you did before? Okay. Yeah, no kidding. Mayb maybe they already expected something. Could could I go to findings? Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence. That way you have no storage, you have no um you do have transportation, still have the labour cost, but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale. The point of sale is online. Right, like Amazon. In fact, we should sell through Amazon, don't you think? Or eBay, yeah. There's an idea. Going with um Ah, we we're do you know, selling a unique product uh. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight. Mm. We're getting used to that. It's not quite like trying on a shoe, but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying. Uh-huh. Great. Works for me. Prototypes, you mean. In um We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it. Any outstanding? No, I'm go ahead. Did you have something? Second generation. Our project doesn't um Ed, d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales? Would it be the Christmas season by any chance? Sports season. Which sport season? So so maybe what So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event. And and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated, because I don't know when the World Cup is, but I'm sure there's gonna be one. Or another m major sports event. Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January. I think that might be a little too aggressive um, but, so, I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh also And to work with motion pictures. There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it, so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example. Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage. That's great. Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact. Yes, it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product, and uh people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away, 'cause it wasn't uh but then when they re-launched them thirty years later, they were virtually the same design, but people had gotten the throw-away, you know, paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um so, you're right, timing is very important, but I think we've got a good product. That's right. It's gonna be very important to the company. Good luck, Ed. You look very relaxed, considering h you know, the uh the weight on your shoulders, yeah. Sounds good. Thank you. Nice working with you.
Probably. Technical pa I would think. Ha. I don't wanna say. Louder. Yeah. Can also be on the side. No, because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything, and it'd be accessible all the time to voice. Yeah. Compliments to the artist. Uh. Well, the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings. Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh Well we haven't come to mine yet, so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion, yes. Well, it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis, we do not have a L_C_ display. L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive, it's gonna be It's not it doesn't say. We don't have the price up there, okay, so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote, now we're up around about twelve, twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested. Um Display in. But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also, and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration. Uh this is just production cost, it is not uh advertising cost, it's not transportation cost uh And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company. So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. Yes. Slightly. It's gonna be very hard to reduce. That's not bad. If we can go to to my display. And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market. So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. If I'm still here. Yep. The four gives me it's gotta be uh TrendWatch. No. It shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one. No, no we g no, that's the same one. You have to go back and find another one. Whatever name it popped up under. Uh functional, try functional, it might not be it either, but we'll see. Yep, that's it. So we'll go screen by screen. Although since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year. Okay? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study. So if we continue, we'll look at the findings. Next screen. Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year, which is actually a tremendous amount. No kidding, yeah. So, if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro, okay, we're already in that that price, okay, with transport, promotion, labour, because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers. Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units. At two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit. Okay? So, obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form, the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we've gone through these. Now, the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. Or we project this over two years, but being that the market changes very very quickly, maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now. So, now we have to come up with a decision. Can the company sell two million units? Can it sell it for fifty Euros? S Upscale technology. Well. There are several companies that have gone that way. Weight, the feel of the product, but There are several that have gone through with the watches, too. You can customise a watch, you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production, you can change it uh There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now. And when you're rotating, you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this, maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year, which could you know, feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit. Well, obviously. Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea, to see get get their I think we pretty much covered everything. Well, then it may not be. Like people don't like wood. very specific. Hmm. Right before the Eur the World Cup. World soccer. World Cup soccer, they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control. Or any major sports. Yeah, I'm the one who takes the heat. If it's a flop, it's the marketer. Yes. Yes. Stress. Celebration. Very good. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Yep, okay, see you later on.
Yeah. Thanks. Mm, okay. I've done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we've both done, so if I'm missing anything, Christine can just correct me. It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world, but Three. Um. No it's think it's the last one. No, then this is the la yeah, that one, final design. It is named appropriately, you just couldn't see the name. Um okay, can I have the mouse? Thanks. Alright, so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, the material that we chose was wood, and uh the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour. Um, so in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design, if we figure out it's too expensive, well then you just take it off. Um, so to unveil our lovely product. This is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see. So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display. Um, this is actually hard to do. The yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss. You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume. So up volume up, down volume down. The green are the channel changing. S And it's one of those very light, very touchable displays. And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom, and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_, and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition. So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time. So. Oh yes. Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front. So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control. Yeah. But it shouldn't be under the flip either, because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice. But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice, why use the voice, why not just use your hand? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up, I can just use my voice. Yeah. And you don't wanna let go of either one. I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip, it can be on the side somewhere. Yeah. So, I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yes. And maybe the shape of the buttons, the little egg shapes aren't the most economical, but Yeah. I mean this is plasticene. There's only so much you can do. We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well. But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light, because they don't feel like they have enough control over it. So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy, but I think it needs to have some weight, it needs to feel like you're still holding something. So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually. Yeah. No we do, but it's not filled in. It's number thirty. Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right, sorry, yes. Um-hmm. Yes. That's no, I think it's the same one. Functional. It looks like it, there's S Yeah. Um-hmm. Mm. I was thinking the same thing, yeah. Directly. Um-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. You can do a shipping centre somewhere, or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs. Yeah. That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as, whereas if you're in a store, you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person, you may not really know what it is you want, whereas on the web, if you have a bunch of pictures, it can sort of trigger ideas and Yeah. The weight and feel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. What turnaround time do we have? 'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task. No no. We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory. What ab Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. No, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. Yes, but I'm not everybody. I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. We have our own motivations in mind, we have our own ideas in mind, but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell. Yeah, of course. I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's actually good place to advertise it too. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's just something to to keep in mind, 'cause it's really really important. A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped, when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy. Really? That I didn't know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Exactly. Okay. Thanks. Bye.

You need to work on the weight a little bit .
@highlight
And maybe the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but I'm satisfied .
@highlight
We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well .
@highlight
And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it .
@highlight
So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually .
@highlight
Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings .
@highlight
Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget .
@highlight
So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells .
@highlight
Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that .
@highlight
So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button .
@highlight
actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh below the budget , Well we haven't come to mine yet , so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes .
@highlight
.
@highlight
It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?
@highlight
on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display .
@highlight
L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , No we do , but it's not filled in .
@highlight
We don't have the price up there , you're right , sorry , yes .
@highlight
okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested .
@highlight
Um So that means we can put the uh the L_C_D_ in , yeah .
@highlight
But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company .
@highlight
So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways .
@highlight
so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .
@highlight
Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh It's gonna be very hard to reduce .
@highlight
Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro .
@highlight
so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .
@highlight
So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project .
@highlight
since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year .
@highlight
Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually a tremendous amount .
@highlight
if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers .
@highlight
At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit .
@highlight
I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these .
@highlight
Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production .
@highlight
but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .
@highlight
So , now we have to come up with a decision .
@highlight
Can the company sell two million units ?
@highlight
Can it sell it for fifty Euros ?
@highlight
Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence .
@highlight
You can do a shipping centre somewhere , In fact , we should sell through Amazon , Or eBay , yeah .
@highlight
That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight .
@highlight
The weight and feel .
@highlight
but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying .
@highlight
maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit .
@highlight
I don't think that's uh not possible , okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real .
@highlight
Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently .
@highlight
We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .
@highlight
Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks .
@highlight
Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay .
@highlight
So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design .
@highlight
So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the second generation .
@highlight
The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of .
@highlight
Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit .
@highlight
No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up .
@highlight
I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need .
@highlight
well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ?
@highlight
Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ?
@highlight
The sports time .
@highlight
Sports season .
@highlight
Right before the Eur the World Cup .
@highlight
World soccer .
@highlight
World Cup soccer , So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event .
@highlight
Yeah , that's a good idea .
@highlight
but , so , I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event That's actually good place to advertise it too .
@highlight
There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage .
@highlight
A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .
@highlight
so , you're right , timing is very important , Okay , so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon .
@highlight
Okay for uh but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design Yes , the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay .
@highlight
I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value .
@highlight
and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over","```

ES2007a.json,"Is that alright? or Okay. Keeps coming off. 'S fiddly. Right. Oh, another one. Ah. Very nice. 'Kay. Okay. Clip. Ah. It's an elephant. Oh my gosh, I'm never gonna be able to draw that well. Does it? Oh. Mm. I have no idea what my favourite animal is. Oh. It's A what? Alright. How. No. Great. Me? Okay. Not quite sure how this is gonna work. Cool. Uh well I'll try my best to draw. Can I just draw the face? Ooh. It's a cat. Which also has what? A big fat body and big and a long tail. Why? Because um cuddly. And usually cats are very friendly. Usually. And they're healing as well. They heal. And they can feel when a human's got problems so So, that's why I like cats. There we are, that's me. Mm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Market range internationally sold. Ah right okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control. Well. A new remote control for T_V_. What would I like? Um. Medium. Mm. Twelve fifty. Each. Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out? Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick. I mean remote controls can be thin bits. And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out, and then you have another one, you slide it out. have slides. And then it all comes compact into one. So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner, and um into one basically. So you just flip them out. That would be cool. I was thinking that like a flip. Okay. Um.. But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though? I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm. Mm. I think a flip up thing, 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway, like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach, and you'd come and sit down and ooh, the telephone's the television switched on or something. So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes, so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something. Yeah. But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it. So make it Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And even for kids as well. It's um it's safer for them, I guess. Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto. Mm. W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for? Ah ri okay. these are requirement specification. And I'm marketing. These are requirement specification. So what the user requires in a remote. I guess that's what it says. Mm. So, do we take these off?
Yeah. The back end of an elephant. Aesthetic yep, sure. 'Kay, my favourite animal, uh let's see. Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before. It's a liger, a combination of a lion and tiger. Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite? Oh it's a hilarious movie. You have to see it. And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal. But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it. There go. A prairie dog? Oh a squirrel? Yeah, that's pretty good. Alright. So I think before we close uh, we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where. I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide. Uh S Yeah, I think we're I mean before we close the meeting, we're supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think this is just the preliminary, get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe. Yeah, I think we've all got Mm. Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas, I mean, you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player, or something like that, but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. Mm. Yeah. It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit. Cost. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if that's like I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. Oh. Oh okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design, what effect the apparatus should have. Okay. Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface, but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_, but also devices connected to the to the T_V_, I mean, be able to operate D_V_D_ players, things like that. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah, I mean. Yeah, that's true, maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote, and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use, uh simple to use, and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote, like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people, certain certain demographic Yeah, no I think you're right. Yeah, rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah. Yeah. Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside. Yeah, that's true what you were saying, I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function, it can just have a lock function, so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable. I guess that's good good for now. That's me. Okay. Right. Right. Yeah, it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap. Yeah. Alright, see you in thirty minutes.
So we're 'kay? On the or No. I dunno where to put it 'cause the Okay. Could you s take it off?. Okay. Are we free to take notes uh Okay. Okay. So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm. Yeah. okay. So my favourite animal 'Kay um Um okay, it's big, it's got a great memory. Supposed to have a great memory, we say an elephant never forgets. And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me. Nice animal. Okay. No. Really? Oh that's a Not bad I would say. Very good. Mm. Yeah. Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make? Okay. T But how do we know how much uh, I mean, how much do we have per how much? Twelve fifty. So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I don't know how much it would cost. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff, and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel, program plus and minus, and the just the mute button, for example. I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated. Yeah. Or grandma as well, you know it's like what is the mute button. No, but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons, but Start breaking up. Yeah. Yeah. Could be really light or, I dunno, something special. Yeah, 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote, doesn't say com combination with all all the r Mm. Okay. That's Mm. Mm. Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap, because Yeah. I don't
Mm-hmm? Okay. Ooh. Hmm. How do we sta wa how do we start? Does anybody know? So that's this Oh okay, right. Uh.. Hmm. Okay, just hang on a second everybody. I haven't actually looked at this yet. um I haven't looked at it, but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens. If you're all ready. So is the agenda? Opening, acquaintance, tool training and project plan, discussion and then closing. Project aim is a new remote control. It's original, uh trendy and it's user-friendly. Project method, functional design, individual work, another meeting, conceptual design, individual work, and a meeting of details design, individual work and a meeting. Tool training. Try out the whiteboard, every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal. Um. Uh Miss Industrial Designer, would you like to go first? Yeah, why don't you just c, I think just clip on clip do you have a belt? Or put 'em in your pocket, yeah. Yeah, what's your favourite animal? Is it rude? That's a very good elephant. 'Kay, and you want to write up on there, it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal. Mm. Okay. Wonderful, well done. Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off? And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next? No. No. Okay, well done. Yeah. Miss mar Miss Marketing? Um yeah, I think you can just draw the face, but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks. That's a very pr pretty cat. Okay, do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it? Wow, so they're kinda spiritual. Well done. Okay. Um, I don't actually have a favourite animal, but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little Uh. I honestly can't draw for toffee. Uh. Yeah. no no uh That's exactly what it is. Uh not a very good one Okay, well, you got it's a s It's a squirrel, and I like them, because they're cute and stupid. Right. Okay, so, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working. Mm. Let's move on to the next page. Okay, project finance, selling price twenty five Euros, profit aim fifty million Euros. Yeah. Production cost, ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make. experience with with remote control, so talk about who who's used what. Any ideas? Stuff like that. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes. At quarter to twelve. Yeah. Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay. I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next, but Okay. Right, who's got experiences with remote controls then? Pretty much everybody. Um. 'Kay um. W what You want it big do you want it small. Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and Video and ts hi-fi and stuff. Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap. 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices, but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. Per unit, yeah. Well at the moment we could, wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like, and then after we after we've found out what we can like, some different ideas, we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not. So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. Um. 'Kay. Okay, that's. Th that's an idea. Okay. One side for kids, one side for adults. Like it or something like a flip telephone, something like that maybe. F flip it open and you've got all the buttons, or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe. Um, oh we've got five minutes left. But okay. Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there. Yeah. I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't, we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything. We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control, that just that is just for a T_V_, but it's just a really good, nice one. What do you reckon? See 'cause, I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make. I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker. Yeah. May w you know, maybe even Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah. Or just one that looks really fucking cool. Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah. I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once, but you know, that's Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well, but that's not gonna happen. Okay, like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones, yeah. Yeah, it's gotta be sellable. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No porn channel for children. Okay. Um alright, so we've got some ideas, we've got um Let's move on. Oops, let's close that. Next meeting, uh okay. Industrial Designer um which is Um. Yeah, there you go. So User Interface Designer, that's that's that's you, so you gotta you go, you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need. Um. Industrial Designer, you are the one, you know, you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess so, um whether it's what goes into the box, somehow. And in marketing User requirements specifications. Yeah, what Right, okay, yeah. You two you two are gonna be just, I think, you just double up, you know, you working together. You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research, see what people want in a remote, what buttons are used more often, and s stuff like that. Oh, we've been warned to finish the meeting now. Okay. Okay everyone, well done. Good meeting. Yeah.

IS1005a.json,"'Kay, hello everybody. Uh, I guess you all know what is it about, you all received the email, I guess. Uh, we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control. So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project. And uh so I'm present myself. I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself. So I dunno, you can starts. Okay. And you are? In the project? So, uh, so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project, so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project. We are talking about the project plan, and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on, and, yeah. So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting. Um. So what is the goal of this project? Is to design a new remote control. So it should be, of course, new and original, and um it should be trendy, and user friendly. That mean it's a very challenging project, and uh uh. So w it's we will try to do our best, and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy. So, um So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way. Um. Yeah and everything is will be like this. Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project. So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here. So uh. For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it. Mm. Uh. So uh So I will ask you all to do the same. Just to get used to the whiteboard. Yeah, yeah, you can draw the picture, of course. Oh. Never mind. Yeah., no worry. You can draw it, if you want. Good. So good um So, let's talk about money. Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro. And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world. So n not only for Switzerland, but for the world. Uh. So, um. The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro. Yeah, of course. Um, so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control, and any idea? So, if you have some experience, good or bad, with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea. Anything. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah, also if y when you take the the remote control, for example on the table, you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud, and you have a heart attack. Okay. Yeah so you can Do you have something? Yeah, that's true. Yeah without obstacles and. Okay. Let's continue. I have a meeting in five minutes, so maybe we should hurry. Um. So we will close uh this meeting. So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes. Um. Uh. The So I will ask you to do some work. Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control, start to to have new idea and read about Yeah. Oh. Industry and Oh. Yeah. So, um For the User Interface Designer, which is Hamed um, uh, you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control. And for the Marketing uh Manager, I dunno, okay, which is Bob, uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control. Um, you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach. Yep finished. So I see you in thirty minutes. Thank you.
My name is Hamed Getabdar, and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project. I dunno if I should go with this. If it is enough line. I'm sorry. Okay. They should be remote. Okay, thanks. No. Okay. Should I clean? Okay, I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful, so if I want to write it here, I think I can. Oh. Okay. I dunno if I can. Okay. It may be like a cow or I dunno, whatever. I'm not good very good in drawing. Okay, so this is very It's a bird, I think. I dunno what is it. Four. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I'm shameful Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh I Yeah, just a simple experience. I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune. Mm. Yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, thanks. Bye.
Uh my name's Bob Mor. Oh, sorry. 'Kay. So my name's Bob Morris. I'm the Marketing Expert for this project. Bob yeah. Yeah go ahead. Okay, okay. So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat. That's its head. Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful. Okay. Thanks. Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something. Uh, that's better. Your lapel microphone's fallen off. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should just continue. Yeah, don't worry about it. No. Oh that's good, it's good. Yeah, and strong. Well, from experience, um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small, and it's been very hard to to to use, because there's so many buttons, and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what, and the buttons are very small and very hard to press. Um and and normally you only every use, you know, on a T_V_ remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons. Um. So it's frustrated me in the past, th that. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay, n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels, or is that Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's the Industrial Designer? No, you're the Industrial Designer. Yeah, I think that's the first. I_D_. Industrial Designer. And the second one is the User Interface Designer. And then last one's marketing, which is me. Great, okay. Thanks guys. Bye.
Now what. Okay, so my name is Petre. You can call me Petre, or Peter if you like. I don't care. Uh, in the project I'm supposed to be the technic. Bob, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So probably I would try to try to draw the animal. Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal? I I th I think I should. Okay, so. Um. Okay, American, um. Um. I would use the bird. So I tried to sketch it out. I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it, but ah. Can you recognise it as a bird? Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay. Yeah. I should get used to the tool, so. Oh just wait a little bit. C could we put it here, to make it as straight as possible? Ah probably not. Okay, it it works like this. Are you left-handed? Oh, pity. Ah, it's maybe better if you leave it. You won't draw them, or? Just try. I would like to see how it looks like. No, I think it's clear. It's okay. It's in it's indeed beautiful. Okay. Bob. Have to remember it. Bob. Per unit, I guess. Y oh okay. Okay. Oh. Okay, I have also some points uh. Maybe two points. Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light. And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room, so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery, so. So something like this. And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control. But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like. You know, some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume, but something which Yeah, but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down, or or make a high volume. Ah, n. If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream. Yeah, f It depends what what you feel about that. Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, but if you have some more notes on that. Okay. Um. Okay, just a second. Which i which is Hamed,? Okay. Uh I am the Technical Designer, I dunno which one, uh v. User Interf Okay. Okay, so I'm the first one. I see. Sign. Okay. Uh.

ES2004b.json,"Help. It's up there? That screen's black. Alright, okay. Okay, that's fine. Are we done? Right, okay um, this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place. Um, right our agenda for today, do you want us to give you a second? Okay, um I'll go over what we decided last meeting, um, we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, T_V_, video equipment. Um, that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone. We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, you know that kind of s thing. Um, our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget, um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it, okay. Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like. Um want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer. We discussed a flip-open design, um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming, things like that. Okay. Um, three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first? No that's fine, that's fine. Unplug me. Um, F_N_ function F_ eight. Mm-hmm. They are. Okay, thank you very much. Um, would you like to continue on from that? Or, maybe move the laptop over. F_ function. Oh, there. 'Kay. Um, I think we'll chat about it at the end, okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end, um Ooh, it's vibrating, that's strange. Oh, God. Right, okay. We just do the best we can. Yeah, you might. Ah. Look at that. Okay. Yeah. Right, um we have new project requirements, um we're not going to be using teletext, um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Um our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us, but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer. It says for T_V_ only, so looks like it's just yeah, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? It just said, for T_V_ only. But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well. I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you? Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, bu We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose, you were saying whistling, maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote, you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there, something like that, but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me. Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo, we want um fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing. Um, people paying more for it to look good. Um, we need to focus on that as well. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about you were talking about the buttons, um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big, rubber buttons, not tiny little one, big, rubber buttons, but what about, I mean, 'cause we got to make it original, what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either, not sure about the You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it. Um, think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking uh young, um office people, trendy kind of a thing. Um, but quite, um, easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, um Were too big. Mm. I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly, um. It's gonna be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities, um. Or a speech recognition, which is extremely expensive, I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue. We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want um it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations. Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people, but I don't think we're focusing on that, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um, business kind of class type people. Mm-hmm. Okay, so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_, we've got the video, now there's um I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, yes. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it, um because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on, that's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just a number. No. You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway. It is after um if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times, um and it has been around for quite a long time. No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Mm. Okay so Mm-hmm. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it. Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do? I think so. Um Instruction manuals. But I mean they're there's customer service, there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge, there's no extra, t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street, um. Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages. It does, you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it, so that should be something we think about. Um, what other functions? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now, but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? Well they la they they last quite a long time, and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something, but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged. Um, something like that should reduce the size of it. Yeah it could be on that yeah, okay. S Yes. Rechargeable with a docking station. So the rechargeable which would be your field. Okay. Yes, which it is cheaper in the long run as well. Um, th the shape you got trendy. I don't wanna big box with lots of things, you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either, because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple, um They do. Okay so we've got a flip-screen. Um Okay. 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway. Okay. Can you look into the company logo? Um, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product. I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design, while also making it quite different from anything else that's there. Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different. Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right, I think we have to round it up, um Sure. That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions, making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that. Um it could be it c It yes, it could be uh adv advertisement feature, um rather than design feature, you know, drawing attention to that. And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual, 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful. Yeah. Um We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it, um. Yes. Yes. And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost, um. Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that, um. I think Yep, and different from what's out there. Yep, I think that's us. I think you might get guidance, but um I th Instruction manuals, 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing, u um, they're everyone's got like a big pile of them, but no one really uses them. Um. Yes, right. Okay. Right, okay. I think you can email me, if there's any more questions. Um and I'll be able to not answer them.
Okay, yeah I'll go first. Can I grab the Thanks. What do I have to press? Oh, F_ eight? Oh right, yeah. Okay. Maybe Yep there we go. Okay this is uh the working design, presented by me, the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire. 'Kay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel um or the volume, everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So um, yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one. Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use, wireless and, you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control. Yeah sure. Um no no, if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in. Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across. Um, and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Um, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose, we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information. Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do. It's not a proper circuit, I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment. And then finally, um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good. Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about, uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have, I th that was just sort of a general point there. And that's uh yeah. Alright okay, and yeah, that's that's what I came up with there, so if you wanna Ooh. Function F_ eight yeah. No, no yeah it's just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah sure. There we go, I've got a bit more of the cable. There we go. Uh you should be able to and yeah, there you go. Okay. Huh. T yeah yeah. I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g Yeah. If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box, they have one of those plus boxes, you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so. Yeah. Yeah. Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway. Alright, okay. Alright, okay. Yeah. Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same. Just yeah, yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, yeah that's what I was just yeah. No, well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah. Yeah, speech recognition, but yeah. Mm. Ge uh Yeah. Video plus. Yeah yeah. Just whack in the number. And you w yeah. And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that, you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway, yeah. It's not Yeah. It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things. Mm. Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series. So that yeah. But just to have that function would be would be really good. Yeah. Mm. But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having Yeah, I mean I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that. Yeah. Department, yeah. Yeah. And they're yeah, they should be f yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the uh yeah. Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones, but they come with a charger, I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh Yeah on that as well so. Yeah some sort of docking station or yeah. Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine, and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Oh God. Uh, no that's okay, sorry. Um is it okay if I postpone that til later, I just want to get access to a little bit more information, is that okay? Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there, is that appropriate? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? Mm-hmm. Right, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right? Oh I see. Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. That's a very important part, it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that, whenever you like me to present. No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom, has it? No. Meter adjusting. Mm. 'Kay. Have I got to keep this here? Does it matter? I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I? Uh, whoops. Will it manage? Bit more, oh dear. Oh. Is that okay? Thank you, just pull it closer a little bit. Get it right over, okay, thank you. Okay, um, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. Um, so that's where we started, we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, you can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, so it has obvious design implications there. Um, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, we were quite surprised by that finding, but um that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot, so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. Um, that trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features, that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you, but I think I'll just keep it simple, if there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay? Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control? Just channel-hopping. Would that imply video use? Mm-hmm, yes. Yes. Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons, I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare. So I don't know if that's something we need to look at. Mm-hmm. In fact I've just called up that table there, we asked those two questions, the table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen, that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control? So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there, and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group, I think that's just general fear of new technology. Oh yeah. Right. Mm. Yes. That's a super idea. Yeah. Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African, I dunno, you get the idea. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day, th the engineering design is one thing, it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned, when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again, repetitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough, I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. Um, R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements. I'm j I really can't get my head round this one, this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about. Mm. I know, and it becomes ridiculous, yes I know. Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially um, you know looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Um. Mm. And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trendy people. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage, we want to, you know, not waste money, not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up, first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this. Mm. Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful. Ah, hmm. Right. Superb. Mm. Yes. Right. Excellent, mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features, um, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, they'll phone the company, you can use their telephones. Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Alright. Yes If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel, but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video, we're not gonna put any okay, just a thought. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm. Yeah. Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that, yes okay. Mm. Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious, yes. Sure, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical, these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface. We definitely an ob an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles, we don't want that. Mm-hmm. Slightly curved, curved. Mm. Mm. I mean look at the mobile. I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea, I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top. Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle. Mm-hmm. Okay. Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything. So it's no teletext, it's only for T_V_ and by implication video, our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control, um something about Videoplus. Right. Right. Right, so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_, a reminder about using Videoplus? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements, is this just that was an add-on feature? Uh-huh. Right. Right, so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature? Right. Mm, and the rechargeable batteries. Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements? Mm-hmm. That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at, what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like. Okay. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting? Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved? Okay. Okay. Whoops, questionnaire four. 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think.
Mm-hmm. Sorry. Yep. Okay. Yep. 'Kay. It can be okay, that's okay with me. further. Oops. Why's it not working? F_ eight, right? Okay. Mm why's it in the right? Yeah, it's connecting. okay. Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention, but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um, I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. So purpose, as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah, with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also, so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. Um, that's so this is if you ask me personally, I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that. So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design. Uh any comments like, if you want? Okay. I think you'll have to You can't It'll have to this can't be pulled. You'll have to push it a bit more. Yep. Yeah this is more than enough. Okay. Yeah I think you can pull it out now. Yeah. 'Kay. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that? Ten perc Mm-hmm. Okay. Pens Mm-hmm. Okay. So are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs? Sure. Alright. Right. The features could be same and the body could look slightly different. So Yeah. Yeah, uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that. So, a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups, you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also, the market. Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small, yeah. Mm-hmm. We could focus on the biggest market. If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. Simple. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box, like a chocolate. That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much, so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom, something like that. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. Current. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells, logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model, rather than you know, trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like. A sea shell? Yeah we could look in at that. Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like, that could be the most common design. But we can like think of five, six designs. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For detection, right. Yep, I think True. Oops. We should f I think it's time for us to get back to
@highlight
this is our second meeting Um , right our agenda for today , I'll go over what we decided last meeting , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .
@highlight
Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .
@highlight
We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .
@highlight
try We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that .
@highlight
three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?
@highlight
Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , Okay this is uh the working design , What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ?
@highlight
Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .
@highlight
Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .
@highlight
But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .
@highlight
Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
@highlight
You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
@highlight
if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and that's because of the size of the batteries , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
@highlight
well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
@highlight
Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , Yeah .
@highlight
Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
@highlight
So what the concept is to have a flip-top model .
@highlight
The and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .
@highlight
if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .
@highlight
and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here .
@highlight
The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
@highlight
Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .
@highlight
Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
@highlight
For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control .
@highlight
Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
@highlight
Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .
@highlight
Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
@highlight
Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .
@highlight
So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , if there's any more information I can email you extra details , we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but I don't know , what do you think ?
@highlight
Would that imply video use ?
@highlight
But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .
@highlight
I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .
@highlight
Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .
@highlight
Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market .
@highlight
Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
@highlight
The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
@highlight
um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control Okay , so the remote control functions .
@highlight
and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .
@highlight
I think we have to design one product Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .
@highlight
Um we've got the T_V_ , we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , Video plus .
@highlight
We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , I've not come across that function if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ?
@highlight
Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
@highlight
But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .
@highlight
Instruction manuals .
@highlight
there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
@highlight
But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , Um , what other functions ?
@highlight
oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about .
@highlight
Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
@highlight
th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .
@highlight
yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
@highlight
Rechargeable with a docking station .
@highlight
Um , th the shape you got trendy .
@highlight
I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back .
@highlight
so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .
@highlight
I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .
@highlight
I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , You could have different kind of casings .
@highlight
So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .
@highlight
So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .
@highlight
Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .
@highlight
That's not at the moment a requirement , And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .
@highlight

I'm Nathan, I'm from California, and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology. U_C_L_A_. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Wow. No. Sounds nice. Oh, wow. There's more vomit there. Alright. Yep. Um Let's see. Yeah, that's the music I grew up listening to. And so there Something I miss about my hometown. Burritos that cost less than eight Pounds. I grew up in San Diego, but yeah um La Jolla, P_B_. But really uh I last lived in San Francisco, I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen. It's different. 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them. Yeah, it really does. Mm. Yeah. Where you from in San Diego? Okay. Yeah, my grandparents lived on um thirty second. Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is, and Cafe Forte Cool. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Mm. Sounds interesting. Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that. Yeah. Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones. Yeah. Yeah. S smaller's better. Simple. Oh right. That'd be different. Yeah. It's gonna be too complicated, too crowded with buttons and things. Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes. Right. I think, making it out of a nice material would be very important, because so many of those remotes that you see, these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality. Mm. something, uh we'll have to come up with a name, patent it. Leopard print. I think, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. Mm. True. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. 'S true. Okay. Alright.
Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small. Okay. We're okay? We're good? I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee. Mm. Uh okay. Very official. You're just gonna believe me, we'll go from there. Fair enough. Prove it yeah, okay. Works for me. There you go. I'm Sarah, I went to Michigan, and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something. Marketing, yeah Expert. Expert. Fine. That's me. So. So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us? I'm waiting to know. Uh Fair enough. Oh, Smallville. I went to high school with Tom Willing actually. The guy. Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless. Yeah. He is a big guy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good call. Interesting. I guess I'll go next then. Okay. Don't wanna lose all my mikes, plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice huh? Okay. Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here. Um. Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of, Chris Bathgate, local Michigan folk singer, really lame and uh uh what else did I bring with me? Probably classical, to totally geek it out, yeah I think. And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down. So yeah. No. Are you getting it online, or is it on sky? Yeah, that'd be nice. 'Fraid not. Mm. Exciting. That'd be. Oh. I didn't even read those. Oops. I shouldn't admit that. Yeah. It's the five by five, I can't read that much. Yeah oh it's so horrible. Oh my God. Seriously? It really is Yeah. Slide it in there. Yeah. Yeah fair enough. I've already got more than I can keep track of. And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people, no. I know. I know. Oh it should be interesting. Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back. They're gonna love that one. Probably. Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide. 'Cause nice. Of course. Oh, now I can think of so many other ones. That's how it works. Mm. Oh Any thing that are like free. Nice. It must make all the difference. Ah. Right. Mm. There you go. Mm. Makes sense. Uh. What they're looking for. And negotiate that. Uh. I don't think there's any rules about it yet. So Yeah. Mm. W yeah. I like the little cover thingies. Hmm. Good idea. Start your minutes. Um Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right, we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things, as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do, like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing, but then, I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons, you can't tell what they do. Yeah. Specific. Okay. Interesting. True. Mm. Mm. Right. We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart, that whole yeah. Hmm. Mm. An interesting option. Yeah. Definitely. Right. That Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Keeping it nice and slick, would be important. And I don't know, like, there's such a problem with losing them, that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose, so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool. Yeah. Fi b like what are they called, those face plate things? Isn't there a name for them? Are they? I dunno. Yeah. Something really cool. Leopard print or something. Hmm. True. Right. True. Right. Right. Right. Probably. Good. Mm. Yeah. And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years, very much so. Mm. Right. Right. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. Or if you our users in mind, like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design, no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to, and who we're gonna be able to get it out of. But Euros. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm. Okay. With half an hour? 'Kay. Perfect. Cool.
How're we placed in terms of the alright. It fell That's why. Ah. Sure. Mm. I'm Ron. I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer. Go for it. Alright. Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_. Anybody? No? no? Afro beat orchestra, very cool. Yeah. Fift S they like fifteen members from Brooklyn. Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium, in Brussels in April first. Yeah. It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways. Um thing I love about Edinburgh Love um I just came from Glasgow and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately. Um. I w Does uh yeah. Ready? Minging? Nice. Uh-huh. Nice. Nice. I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control, we can't kind of build it into other uh products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Nice. Hot. Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here? S does anybody have any initial ideas? But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. Too confusing. Mm-hmm. Possibly. I'm pretty sure there is. I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world. Oh. I like the idea of the uh multi plate. In in I like. We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well. For those cold winter days. Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it. If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying. Th Yeah. That's cool. I think we could design into that. Curves. We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros? Slight difference I guess. No. Thank you.
Like that? Okay, cool. Okay? Right, so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick. Yeah, PowerPoint. Yeah, well, you know,. Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it. Right. Um. So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction, this is uh so it right. Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting. Um We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training. Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet, the whiteboard. Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up. Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that, I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell. Um so um if you say something about marketing, right, sorted, um y is Exactly. Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it. I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so, 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um. And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun, you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that, why not, you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it. So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical? Sweet. Cool. So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website. Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible, that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something. So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way. Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics. And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember, the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright, getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time. And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good, you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um, yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand, or something like that. Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up. So that's the detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing. Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could, not all five, if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um. Oh, we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm a excellent Project Manager. Um. I'm Marty, um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology. Um yeah. So Expert Don't play yourself down. Expert Where did you go to uni Nathan? Oh brilliant. Cool. My little brother goes there. Right so desert island discs. Yeah. Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down. See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are, I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but there's some other options, if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it, it's rubbish but I love it. T the the main c the main character? Wow. Is he a wanker? He looks really tall, like he's gotta be like six six. Yeah. Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys heard of Jeff Buckley? Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have. Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead. It's a r Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think. It's kinda weird. Anyway yeah. Yeah, you're like press and it's. Kinda cool. You'll see. Alright so um whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want. Right on. W Mm. Nice. Okay yeah yeah. Well yeah. Oh, family guy. Isn't h has h do you watch the new season? I think I'm gonna start downloading it yeah. Mm-mm. Afro beat orchestra? Very cool. Mm. Wow. That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for. It's they're designed specifically to ignore. I it's th brilliant. Ah yes yes yes okay I see that. Vomit. Yes. Street pizza. It's so brilliant. I've seen more urine in this city than ever before, I mean It's so minging. Uh. I'm going local. Going local. I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right. Oh, have you been home yet? They'll be like, say something British, and you're like oh shut up family. Right you s you're gonna stay here? Wow. Bad religion? Yeah yeah, yeah. Well yeah that's why yeah. I miss coffee. Burritos. Oh yeah two two bucks. Where are you from in California by the way? Did you really? What part? Yeah I'm from San Diego as well. Yeah oh man. Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego. Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay, it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks, like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that. Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego, I live like five minutes from the zoo. So North Park actually if you want to get real specific. Yep. Yes. On university, yeah. Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house. Yeah, pretty cool. Small world as we were discussing before. Especially when we're all from the same general region. Right so okay, success on the whiteboard. You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know, I think we'll Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance. Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros. Um. This is what the finance department has told me, the C_F_O_ but I don't know, I'm not sold on this, it's pretty dear, I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote. It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me. Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it, the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it. Eur internationally. So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing. Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty. So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can. Um s right so um just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager, sorted. Um. Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it. Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do. Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want. So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have, you know like uh so yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email. But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth. Um any questions, before we get started? You mean to like Hmm. Yeah. Well, have a think about it. I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it. I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function. The clapper. No I mean no, good idea, good idea. We'll see what see what Uh-huh y I like that Yeah. That's true, I guess we we probably have some time, maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do, go back to um I don't really have any. Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish. Uh project announcement. Ts ts ts Yeah. Not so much. All right we'll find them, we're on our own. Yeah yeah let's do it, let's do. I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause Yeah I mean oh yeah right. So initial ideas. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's slick isn't it. I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah. Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this, perfect. Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality. Um and we also I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote? I don't think one exists. Be a good idea. Yeah all the other universal remotes. Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there, I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL, N_T_S_C_, region one Okay. Okay. Interesting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um all right. So. I li I'm liking that idea, this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features. Um. Um. Let's see. Mm. Uh let's see. Um. Yeah yeah okay. Think they're just called face plates? I don't know. Um. Mm. But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote. Um Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page. Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones, you have a page button and it goes, could we do something like that? Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know Yeah. Yeah. We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno, selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote, twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price. Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive, some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere. But um have a think about what we can do, have a think about what we want to do, how we're gonna sell it and um Mm. Twenty five Euros. Yeah. They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar. Although, computer parts, all if you're gonna upgrade your computer, buy it in the States. Like um do you guys know Fry's? Huge computer uh electronics store? They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about. Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now, I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents, so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas, you can consult them at your leisure. And uh right so thanks for that. Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into. Um. Yes. Thanks guys.

ES2009b.json,"All set? Okay. Cool. Right. So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control. And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only. So no we're not doing D_V_D_, we're not doing anything else, it's just gonna be a television remote. Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it. Um so that's red and black. And it has to have the slogan, case you guys forget the slogan it's, we put fashion in electronics. Um and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do, so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design. For reasons that I don't really know. There's but it's the board so there you go. So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote. Anyway. So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on Oh, right yeah. Yep. Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up. Yep. Cool. Brilliant. 'Kay. Mm. 'Kay. Fair enough. 'Kay. Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers, or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice, you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with? Okay, okay. Great. Thank you very much Nathan. Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well. S plug yourself in here. Mm. Um hit function F_ eight real quickly, hold down Mm. There you go. Sweet. Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before. Oh yeah look at that. Mm-hmm. Nice. Okay. Great. Thanks for that Ron. 'Kay yep that's you. Give it a little bit. That's great. Thank you Sarah. Right. So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here. I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase. Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control, um so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. Yes. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. Um. So uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well, we've got this idea, Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um, which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly. Um so um. How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable, um at least for the basic controls, maybe we can balance it that way, you know we can see. Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up. Mm. Right. The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too. Yeah. Or an isolated magnet or something like, or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that, I like that, the voice recognition for the paging system. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Absolutely. Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know, that's perfectly viable question. Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group, aim it at them, but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control. Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many, we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well, we don't have many um. I appear to have lost my microphone. Mm. Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool. Um right. I guess we've c we've touched on most of this. The idea of a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates. Um. The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen? Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it, we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth, um. True, if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important. Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing, n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations? Yeah yeah okay. Um Yeah I think that would be best. Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost, try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea. With a touch screen for the basic functions. Um And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen. Um do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls. Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost. Mm-hmm. But then again that costs as well. Hmm. Do they? Okay. Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology. Okay so let's go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into, if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know. Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know, you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics. Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery, focus on um uh presentation. Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off, channels, volume, um and um a small paging function. Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging. Just a beep. Um right so any comments? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this. W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control. Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno, what do you guys think? Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there. Jus But apparently not. So. Yeah. Well fair enough. Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on. But then again who wants to turn on a remote control. Kind of if i Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode. Okay. Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen, nice. Um. Um cool so any last things before we break? Alright. Fair enough. Sounds good. I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders. I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference. Brilliant. That's fab guys. Cool.
Okay. So do I unplug this bit here? Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation. So the uh method. We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project. Um remote control works as follows. This is all pretty basic stuff you guys. Um sends message to another system, so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power, something along those lines, there's an integrated circuit, which is the microchip, um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well. So my findings, um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like, and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer, just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Um, components. Just some ideas that I had, um, energy source, it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. Um the user interface, I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip, um, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that, we can't really be different in that respect. Um, the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard, multi channel, that's a word I made up, I don't really know what it means. Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range. Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices. Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s. Um personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, um, the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value, 'cause we were thinking Right. Yeah that shouldn't be a problem. Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do. That's the end of my presentation. Is it plugged in well? There it goes. Computer adjusting. Mm. Mm. Right. I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep and therefore be found. Oh yeah I think that's very doable. Mm. It's a good point. Yeah. Mm. I was thinking uh Oh go ahead. Yeah. Gotta wonder though, if we're adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things. It seems like, we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip. The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism. So it's just something to consider. Back to the uh the cost the material. We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates, it's gonna drive the cost up. And the other question is, if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market? We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there's even interest out there. Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere. Yeah. Can we afford to include one of those? Right. Okay. Since we're doing uh touch screen, do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody. What what would be on that touch screen? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto, I can't remember exactly what you said. 'S too much. Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen. That'd be okay. Mm. True. People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on. They just want it to be on and ready to go.
Th Well so. Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. Um so a few of the requirements we need here. Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device, it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem. Um so some of my findings. Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set. Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television, uh switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does. Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice it's quite a boring design. Um. Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions, um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. So my personal preferences. Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control. Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with. And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there. Um. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh. I can plug you in. Sounds good. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television. And you just say something to into that and it finds your The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market. And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not. 'S definitely an option technically. I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not, they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point. Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct, I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable. We could have the casing, the the face plates. Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room. Uh. Sure. Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Interface? So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen? Those new ones. Be interesting. We put fashion into electronics. Yeah. Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that, I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device. I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on. Mm-hmm. Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on. Yep. Goes into a sleep mode. I've put my files in the shared folder as well.
Okay. Gotta plug you in. Very nice. For your first PowerPoint it's lovely. Fine. It needs, yeah. Cool. Looks like you're in okay. There you go. Right. Does that mean I'm up? I think so. Okay. Oh that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide show up and running. Or not. Uh. Oh there we go. Perfect. Okay. So this is me. Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, m the majority of the time that's all that's going on, the other functions happen, for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they're not using a lot of it, they don't need it, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes, and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, that's up to the design people, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about. Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us. Need to unplug this? Need it back. There you go. Oh right. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so. Right. Right. Uh. Right. Yeah. Oh. That could work. I like that. Yeah. Something very basic. Right. Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then? Okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. K Yeah. True. Making it just an option? Yeah. Right. Are we still thinking about this screen sorry. Go ahead. The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing, it would be still, do we know if that's an option technically right now to that? Okay. Okay. We're doing okay. 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions, you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition, settings, things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for. True. Worth looking into. Yeah. True. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Just the casing. Mm. Yeah. Right. Mm. Right. Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around, it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home, so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ True. True. True. Yeah. Oh yeah. True. 'Cause it would have a docking base? Yeah. Can we afford that? And will somebody buy it if we don't? Right. For twelve Euros? It is. Fair enough. The basics. Mm. 'Kay. Mm. And oh. Yeah the the fashion do. Yeah. Right, and then you're dealing with ports and cords and Yeah. For now. Yeah. Nice. Um. Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away, perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think. Yeah. Y Yeah you would think. But. If it comes from above. Yeah. Mm. We're good? Yeah.

@highlight
have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Yeah I think that would be best .
@highlight
based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic With a touch screen for the basic functions .
@highlight
Um let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .
@highlight
it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .
@highlight
Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .
@highlight
'Cause it would have a docking base ?
@highlight
But then again that costs as well .
@highlight
these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?
@highlight
I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control to emit some kind of paging .
@highlight
Just a beep .
@highlight
Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ?
@highlight
Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .
@highlight
What what would be on that touch screen ?
@highlight
'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto , it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .
@highlight
Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .
@highlight
it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .
@highlight
Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .
@highlight
it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .
@highlight
People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .
@highlight
They just want it to be on and ready to go .
@highlight
But then again who wants to turn on a remote control .
@highlight
all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .
@highlight
or go into like a dormant mode .
@highlight
I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders .
@highlight
and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .
@highlight
I've put my files in the shared folder as well .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Project Update**

So, my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um Okay. Oh, good point. Ah, the eyes always ruin it. Right. Okay, what do it's eyes like? Okay, cool. Um this is a rabbit. Yeah, I don't think it's furry enough, so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit. Okay, right, it's a fluffy rabbit, blue. Rabbits don't come in blue but you know. Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy. And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink. Okay? I am the um I need my notebook, mm ooh top banana. Thank you. Okay, cool, I am the Marketing Expert um so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design, um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design um so yeah. Um I'm from Leicester, um second year. Um what else do you want to know? I like sports um yeah, aerobics, kickboxing, spinning um and uh not with rabbits, no no. And vets, I like vets as well. And yeah um and I like cocktails, especially pink ones. Okay? Cool. Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit. I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though. They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns. It looks like Eeyore. Horns, draw some horns. Is that a lizard? Is there a difference? If you right click on it you can Yeah, I was looking at the website, and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional, you know? So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. You know, so something heading towards that, so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls, so I figure how many do you need, you know? Okay. Something that's a little less crowded than this, like I mean you know, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_, right? But what do most people do? They turn it on, they watch certain specified channels, you know, and then they turn it off again. Sometimes they play a movie. Yeah, so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that, maybe to do Yeah. So, if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works, then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons, which just confuse them. Hmm. 'Cause like if you look at the train, it's just very like, there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people, but it looks really pretty too. Mm-hmm.
... Mm, yeah. I didn't receive it yet. Not at this point. Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat. Yeah now I now I understand now, yeah. Yeah. Ah. Okay. Um so my name is Maarika. Where's the pen? Okay. Yeah, well, or I can make it smaller. Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal, I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals, but I do like dogs. Oh, sorry, maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm. Um well, there are different kinds of dogs, but okay um. Okay. Yeah, maybe it has some colourful patches, yeah. Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal. Mm, well that's compared to some other animals like cats. Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent. Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well, yeah. Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say. Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something, yeah. I'm from Estonia uh, yep. Um so is there anything else you'd like to know? Oh, right, my roles, um so um in the different um stages of the design, so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah, designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design. Okay, that's it. Thanks. It looks very very cute. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Wow. Ah, a gecko, okay. Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah, they are mm-hmm. Ah. Mm-hmm. I hope you don't like snakes, do you? Okay. Mm-hmm. Wonderful. Yep. I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones. Mm-hmm. Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones, because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning, yeah, yeah. Hm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. See you.
Okay. So, this is uh first meeting of this design project. Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting, I don't know if it was sent round to all of you. Maybe not. Anyway, this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly, um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already. Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more. Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings, um specifically the whiteboard over there. Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it. And then that's it. So we've got twenty five minutes to do that, that's until eleven twenty five. S so any any questions? Is i not at this point. So this is our project. What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. Um we want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user friendly, so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product. The method that we're going to use to complete the project, that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the the remote control. We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that. Um similarly with the conceptual design, we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together. Um and then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together. I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing. Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah. Okay, so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself. Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project, specifically the whiteboard. So each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. Would you like to go first? Oh, yeah, p put them in pockets. You don't have to hurry, we've got plenty of time. It's got no eyes. I thought it might be a cat. Yeah I can see by the ears. Mm. Excellent, and what's your what's your role within the team? Mm-hmm. And more about yourself, you're from? Mm-hmm. But not with rabbits. Excellent, to match the rabbit. There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off. Ah it looks like a dog. the other legs are on the other side.. And where where are you from? Estonia. Good luck. Mm. It's eating. Yeah. Excellent. Right, now now it's my turn obviously. Okay, here's a space. Yeah, I like the cow. I'm Jen. Um I like dogs too, but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can. I like Mm. Hmm. It's a gecko. Yeah. They're Yeah, they're l it's a kind of lizard. And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and, and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening. I don't like snakes. I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes. That's where I'm from, Australia. I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product. Okay. So, let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation. So, I've just thought yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go. Okay, so this is the um overall budget for our project. We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away, that means we've got five minutes. Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each. Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_. Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target. So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing. Okay. Hmm. This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing, okay. We've only got a couple of minutes. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control? Mm-hmm. I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us, but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary. Something something new. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, no. It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Oh I haven't had a look yet, yep. Mm-hmm. Great. Any other immediate thoughts before we move along? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in, but the designers thought they were great. Okay, so we need to wrap it up now, so that we can go away and get on with some of this. Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes, so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace, but im basically you're looking at the working design, you're looking at the technical functions design, and for you it's the user requirements specification, like you said at the start. Okay? Thanks for that. Uh I'll see you in half an hour. Carry the laptops back again. Do we need to unplug things? Probably.
Mm-hmm. so sh. I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design? Uh i is it just uh more detail, uh as I understand it? Right. How how it will be done. So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product? Okay. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay. Mm. Cool. Mm. That's not bad at all. Yep... Thank you. Okay um I'll do some I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay. 'Kay um my name is Gaurav. Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow. I've got no idea how to draw a cow. Uh this is going to be Yeah, that'll do. Okay, so let let me draw the body first. Big, round body, really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face. And there is some grass there. So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass, they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of Buddhist in a way. So yeah, I like cows. Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer, so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role, what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design, what are the various components of it and um finally, I'm not too sure what was the last part. Um the detailed design, I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other. Um I'm from India. Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics, I sit at the Department of Psychology. Yeah. Thank you. That doesn't look like a cow, does it? No way. Ah okay. Uh-huh. Mm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy, user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned, that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this. Mm. Alright. Mm. Yeah. There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time, but will be used ten percent of the time, yeah. Yep. And then use the Mm. Mm. Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life, although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway, battery life, uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries. Um Hmm. Yeah. A big learning curve, yeah. Yeah. So, i it should kind of fit in as well, and the stereotype of a yeah. Alright.. Hmm.

So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. Um Yeah. Um Yeah. Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again. So now we we have the okay, so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. Um well, everything else is probably user interface, so. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, it has, yeah. Yeah, well, but i since it's made of rubber anyway. I I think it's it's uh Yeah. Mm. Hmm. It's on the side. Uh no, we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials. Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options. Mm. Mm. Yeah, it's hidden in there somewhere. Cool. We ran out of resources here, so. You can have a look. Yeah, see the budget. I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. So? Yes. Okay. But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger. But then yeah. Yeah. So bu it's it's not a huge problem, because i i it is operatable. Right. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, so it opens on the side. So Yeah yeah yeah, I mean yeah. So you guys can decide wh whether Oops.

Fifty one divided by Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit. Mm. Advanced, yeah. Yep. Mm anything uh I think which is not more. Yeah. Mm. No uh we we have uh yeah. Mm no. We don't have we're not using any of that. Huh? Wh wh what is the limit? Uh. Mm I don't think so, no. No it says what what is the kind of interface, if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display, so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have. Wh wh what's our criteria? Uh okay. Uh it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello. Mm and the locator also goes away. A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Uh I mean uh um yeah. Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button. No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing. That comes with the L_C_D_? Oh so so the the this is. So we're adding costs for right, okay uh I mean I think this is good. Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. On the side. Mm uh it sounds good actually, yeah.. We have, yeah. Not really, no. Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display. We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons. Um yeah. Yeah. But we lose the locator. So instead of speaker,. 'Kay. I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. Um we kap kept a adding things randomly. So, had we known Yeah, that or not, yeah. Yeah. So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented. Mm. Yeah, mm. Yeah yeah yeah, that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I guess it was a fairly small group, so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I thought that was good though, because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah. Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute. We certainly are, mm. Yeah. Yeah, same here. Mm uh no. I don't think so. Was there a questionnaire already sent?
Okay. This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. And again I'll take minutes. The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently. Um then then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against. Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through. So we've got forty minutes. S 'Cause we missed out. So it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five, so we've got until four fifteen. Is that right? Yeah, until about four fifteen. So yeah. Go for it. Do you want Yes. Dual use, perfect. Dual use, perfect. Does it vibrate when you press the buttons? Sorry, sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wow. And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that Mm-hmm. Yeah. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Six seven eight nine. I like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you. But if you hold it in, if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in? no. Mm-hmm, very good. And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours. Mm-hmm. Very good, let's have a look. Test it out. Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour, I guess. Very good. Okay, so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues, but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow. We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way. Wales, for example. Marketing Expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right? Mm dots, never mind. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, just prepare one now. I reckon it Yeah. Seven, yeah, it's terribly sexy. Yeah. Ah, okay. Excellent. Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah, I'll take a note, it's fine. Yeah. I think it does. Alright. But that's gonna be a problem, 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Six. Yeah, I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed, so in in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good, but we might want to flag it for management, they want might want to um They Mm-hmm. Yeah. The length is gonna be difficu Mm. No, we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. I really like the way you have it, but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to. So Might be But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon. Five? Yeah. I'm happy with five? Yeah. Yep. But otherwise it's superb. Six. Yeah. Well we've banned them from Yeah. Yeah, it's varied. Yeah. Six? Voice control have seven. Ah, that's the second one. So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide. G_ technologically innovative. But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new. Yeah. All of the components have been used in other things before. But do yeah, yeah. Yeah. What do you reckon, five, six? Yeah. Space remote. Put fashion in electronics. Very good. Yeah, one. Or a seven. Fifty one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Six point point about six point five. Close enough. Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it. That's all you've got at the moment, or did you have anything more? That's it? Alright. So, finance. And we'll see if we can unscrew this first. Sorry, this is I'm just um Beautiful. Not anymore. Computer no signal? Adjusting. There we go. Okay, so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost. More or less. Um I started filling it in, but of course these are provisional, so we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right? One simple battery. No kinetic energy, no solar. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it. Case material we said rubber. I don't know what special colour means. It could be Rub rubber comes coloured, it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different. Yeah, let's leave it as zero, 'cause it's easy. We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton, and then we've Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no? S for the muting. Yeah. And button supplements. No. No? But the the spinning wheel's not there. I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display? I think the pushbutton oh. I don't know if that's one Yeah. That seems unlikely. Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Our budget's twelve point five. Yeah, so that has implications though for the. For the locator. Yeah. Yeah. What else does it need? Yeah, 'cause the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated then just a beeping thing. Yeah, okay, so we Uh-huh. Right, so we need one fifty off. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. We could do Yeah. You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute. That's with the L_C_ We decided, 'cause it's not on our list. The scroll wheel is on the side. We're point three over at the moment. It's nothing n Yeah, I have Yeah. Rather than having three different things that people have to do. There we go. Oh look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses. Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour. So that's alright. We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour, if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it, yeah. Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright then. We're gonna have a beep. Yeah. Yeah. Tha. 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh. Yeah, I know I know, my pen vibrates. But only for a very short time. Um okay. So looks like we've designed a banana. Well done, team. Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting, so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product. Feedback? Ideas? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting, that that worked in terms of. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Banana. Mm-hmm, the whiteboard digital pens. We like the pens. Yeah, you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office. They great? Do you think they'd notice if one went? Oh okay. Yep. Shh. Yep. But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint, 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there, yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's alright, that always irritates me anyway, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well. I have no stake in it. You have to say that, 'cause I'm taking the notes. I'll leave the room and you can have another go. Better than that than the banana. I think it worked quite well. Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit? Yeah.. New ideas found. Not quite sure what about. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. Banana remote. Yeah. Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control. Flip. Vibrate. And uh yeah. Nothing that you really want. True. Yeah. Okay. So, costs are within budget, well within budget, including a little what have we got? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. Um we've evaluated the project. You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents file? It's in there already. And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. Were there any was there anything that you found difficult, or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope? Yeah. Okay then. Um I think we're still well within our time. We've got about five minutes left, but if we've finished, then we've finished. We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time. So I would say that's the end of that meeting. Thank you, team. It was very productive day and Mm uh no. Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. I don't know if it's already sent or not. Um presumably I have to I don't see why you can't stay here, really. Did I save this one? Production costs. It was supposed to be pink. But it was blue on the board.
Yeah. Yeah, about four fifteen, yeah. So, you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things, like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well, but it's it's just an a approximation. Uh yeah. Rubber. Yeah,. Um it could be made a bit smaller, and and of course it would be and yeah, but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder, so we said the back side round, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's spongy as well. So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things. So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one. So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here. Yeah. And then, well this is on off button. It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red, so it's it's kind of user friendly. And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one. And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next. The volume is is scrolling. On the side, this one. Yeah you just do it like this. And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. See? So the volume is you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, okay, there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose. You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen, you just push the cen mm the middle button. A mute button. Well, we'll have this on the screen, on the display. Well, but the but the mute yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? Okay, yeah, okay. Yeah. And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface. Yeah. And we do have the logo on it as well. So I think it Yeah. Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website. In the actual one. Yeah. So if you have questions. Yeah. Yeah, the yeah, it's definitely attractive. Oh, the locatable thing we actually forgot. Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now? It will be red, too. S seven was th the maximum, yeah? I I go for seven. I would think yes, yeah. Yeah, so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. Yeah. But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway, so they just Yeah. Yeah, because I mean anyway, right-handed people would be able to scroll with it, so i if the majority are right-handed, it's uh Or maybe six, because it's just one one i one among the issues, I mean. Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah, but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah. So it won't be a problem, it will be and it will be it won't be heavy. Yeah well yeah, but it's it's a bit long. It's a little bit long. Well, I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah. S uh slightly smaller. Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that. Mm that you stick on T_V_. Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included, so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds, so yeah. Yep. Yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's Yeah. Yeah. Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway, yeah? See. Yeah, so it's kinda Yeah. Yeah, it does have yeah. Technologi well Yeah. Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well, which is yeah, it's kind of new. But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new. Six. I mean how how far can you go with a remote control, really? It still has to do what i what it has to do. Yeah, isn't it fashionable? Yeah, sure. It's the maximum fashion. Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days, so. So I think we've done very well, but What's the assessment? The average is about six and something. A little bit over six. No, wait, a little bit under six. No, wait. Oh, three sixes, okay, yeah. Four sevens. Six point something, yeah. Six point five, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, yes. Rubber. I think something coloured, yeah, probably. So I think this is probably special co no? Yeah. Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it, yeah yeah, okay. Yeah. We have pushbuttons, scro we have scroll wheel as well. S yeah, yeah, we had, for muting, yeah. And we have L_C_ display and yeah. Um Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah. Okay, let's yeah. We have to count all of them, or yeah. But it was very no innovative innovativeness. Well um yeah. Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. This would be Yeah, yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah, then then we would be in the b budget. Yeah b no no, you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing. Mm-hmm. But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well. If you Mm. So Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well we're going to have a beeping thing. But yeah, it's it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep, so we still have the locate. Which colour, the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well. It can come in the same colour as the the case. Yeah mm, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the m the means were very very good, the means we used. And the pens. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah. But yeah, but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was I was satisfied with with the leadership, yeah. Mm-hmm. And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely, yeah. To express them mm mm no. Well it's it's it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really, all this flipping open thing and Yeah, neither neither do I, but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this, actually, so. Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one. Patent patent patent. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. And my main difficulty was the the time pressure. Otherwise it's it's all fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you. You can make some animals. Oh, you don't like anim It doesn't? Smells quite nice. Smells very sweet. I made your animal for you. Yeah, that's the one
It does look very cool. And then do we get to make a remote control? Yeah. Yeah. You think bananas are a safe thing to use? It's a bit um phallic. Oh, your remote control? Oh that's just bad. Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller? Yeah. It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable. I wasn't very keen on that, but yeah. So where's the volume? Ah, you did get that in then, mm-hmm. Oh okay,. Cool. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. Yeah. On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute. Yeah, but it's a scroll and click, isn't it? Okay, cool. So that that solves the whole mute issue.. Yeah.. Yeah, oh, we hold the remote. Oh, but it it does feel all cold and slimy. I hate Play-Do, it's just minging. But yeah, uh that's cool, cool. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wales. Mm. Cool, okay. Right, okay. Fabulous, yeah. Okay, cool. So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale, so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again. Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah, we did manage to do that, or oh no, we really forgot about that. Okay? Cool, so these are what they are. Oh Yes, I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points. Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good. Well, I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_? Yeah. Cool. Okay. So, be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Yeah. Oh we're all so proud of the. Okay, so that'll be a seven for A_. Could oh no, you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. Yeah. But that's alright. If you take a note of them, and then I'll put them in in a minute. Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for A_? Cool, okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user? Yeah. I mean Yeah. I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen. Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, but they can normally do most things right-handed, so I would say it's not such a big issue. Yeah. I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb. So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say? What do you what do you all think? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah? Because So you have to keep that side flat. So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but y you know, as long as that side's flat, than that will work. Okay. Um okay, so C_. Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_? There's a locator. Cool, so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though, doesn't it? To make it beep. Or a buzzer. Okay. So that's two, so that's seven, yeah. It's locatable? Fabulous. D_. Yeah. Yeah, and I mean d So, should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different, so, do you know, I mean it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first. So we give that one a five, you think? Yep. I'm glad you're accepting this. It has taken a little while, hasn't it? Um intuitive but Sorry, it's really hard to write on those. I just went a bit mad, didn't I? Um okay, cool, E_, okay. Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here, so possibly for left-handed. Investigate. So, should we give it a six? Six? I used to send fifty texts a day, you know, and I never got repetitive strain injury from that, so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest. Okay, so we give that a six, yeah. Okay, F_. Hang on, how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there? That's just Oh okay, cool. Um right, so. Yes, so that's a seven then. Um, cool. Yeah, but I mean you don't They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think.. Yeah, what do you all think? Six? Well, that's it, I mean Yeah, but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, hasn't it? So, I don't think many peop That's it, they can take it with them. So, we give it seven, and we write There we go. Cool. So, we need the average here, so we got Seven So we've got four sevens, so that's twenty eight, three sixes, eighteen. Two three four Seven eight. Okay, that's pretty good, I think. Um no, that's it, yeah. Cool, there we go.. There we go and there are the marks. Yeah. Yeah, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know. Yeah, you might end up having to take off the sample sensor.. No. We've got more than one pushbutton though, haven't we? 'Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? Not counting anything, we'd still be in budget. Twelve point five. No. Well it doesn't, but it uh And L_C_ display. This sample sensor. Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. Yeah. But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it? We can afford to get rid of it. So that means no locator, does it? I mean does Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. See, I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing, 'cause But that's well you would just have to to spin it down. So that's point three. Yeah, I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more. That's the spin wheel though, isn't it? Didn't that come with the L_C_ Yeah. Yeah. S so we're point three over. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Could b still put them on the side. But yeah. I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve, couldn't we? Yeah, but Yeah. Yeah. No. No, I don't think so. Yeah. We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway, and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think. Really? Cool. That's not a very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. Oh the the beeper thing. It Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate. You know, your pen vibrates? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can. Yeah. I think 'cause the meetings were so regular, you know. It wasn't like we were alone for very long, so you didn't st go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana, and then, you know, come back three days later and Jen's going look, look, it vibrates and it looks like a banana. Um yeah, so yeah. Uh I like the pens. I want one. That would just be so cool, to d do all your notes and s I don't think you should say that was the recording. Okay, cover up the microphone. Alright, let's take it. Okay. It is a bit limiting, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. The thing flew in, you didn't have the whole whooshing thing, 'cause there wasn't time for that, so yeah. Not that you can do that on the board, either. We could make some little Yeah, totally, I mean that was fairly tight anyway, I mean especially with that last-minute alteration. back it, this is just had to be changed. And yeah, so cool. Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now? Yeah, definitely. You weren't like a a dictating leader, so that was always good. I know you've got the pen, you might attack me with it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, I don't go shopping for remote controls that often, maybe somebody's already though of it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay. That looks boring, I'll see if anyone's made a remote control. Yeah, yeah. I think we'd like to think the ideas were new, but we've got no way of finding out. That vibrates Yeah, but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it. Yes. And it's fabulous. It's in the project documents. Yeah, yeah, sometimes it's like a little bit rushed. Yeah, we've got like five minutes left. Yeah. 'Kay. We could draw animals on the board again. I don't like Play-Doh, no. It's just minging. It smells so bad. It does. Mm. No, it hasn't been. Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now? Okay, so the other way.
@highlight
This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .
@highlight
what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , It does look very cool .
@highlight
then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .
@highlight
Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
@highlight
Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .
@highlight
Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .
@highlight
so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things Okay .
@highlight
So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .
@highlight
You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?
@highlight
Well , but it's it's just an a approximation .
@highlight
Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .
@highlight
And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .
@highlight
And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside .
@highlight
And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .
@highlight
yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?
@highlight
Um it could be made a bit smaller , So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things .
@highlight
So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .
@highlight
And then , well this is on off button .
@highlight
and and also the colour is quite often red , And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .
@highlight
The volume is is scrolling .
@highlight
On the side , And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .
@highlight
and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose .
@highlight
Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .
@highlight
Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .
@highlight
On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .
@highlight
Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .
@highlight
yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?
@highlight
if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?
@highlight
But if you hold it in , And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .
@highlight
You can't really see it in the interface .
@highlight
And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .
@highlight
Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .
@highlight
I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .
@highlight
So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .
@highlight
Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .
@highlight
Um , you know .
@highlight
Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .
@highlight
So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .
@highlight
I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .
@highlight
Okay .
@highlight
But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .
@highlight
Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .
@highlight
If you take a note of them , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?
@highlight
so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .
@highlight
So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?
@highlight
Or maybe six , It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .
@highlight
Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .
@highlight
or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?
@highlight
th there's the locator dot .
@highlight
Mm that you stick on T_V_ .
@highlight
so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , To make it beep .
@highlight
so that's seven , yeah .
@highlight
If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .
@highlight
but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .
@highlight
but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .
@highlight
So , should we maybe say f a five so possibly for left-handed .
@highlight
Investigate .
@highlight
But otherwise it's superb .
@highlight
So , should we give it a six ?
@highlight
Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .
@highlight
Okay , so we give that a six , G_ technologically innovative .
@highlight
it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .
@highlight
Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new .
@highlight
All of the components have been used in other things before .
@highlight
They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .
@highlight
What do you reckon , five , six ?
@highlight
Six .
@highlight
Put fashion in electronics .
@highlight
Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .
@highlight
So , we need the average here , So I think we've done very well , The average is about six and something .
@highlight
Six point five , yeah .
@highlight
that's pretty good , I think .
@highlight
so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .
@highlight
And now we have to calculate the production costs .
@highlight
So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .
@highlight
Um I started filling it in , No hand dynamo , right ?
@highlight
One simple battery .
@highlight
The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .
@highlight
We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
@highlight
Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .
@highlight
Case material we said rubber .
@highlight
I don't know what special colour means .
@highlight
I think something coloured , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ?
@highlight
You know .
@highlight
maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .
@highlight
Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , We have pushbuttons , Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?
@highlight
And we have L_C_ display And button supplements .
@highlight
Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel We've got more than one pushbutton though , That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?
@highlight
That seems unlikely .
@highlight
whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we We have to count all of them , I don't think that makes sense .
@highlight
if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .
@highlight
Our budget's twelve point five .
@highlight
Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .
@highlight
so that has implications though for the .
@highlight
Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker .
@highlight
when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .
@highlight
But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?
@highlight
Mm and the locator also goes away .
@highlight
Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .
@highlight
A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber .
@highlight
Right , so we need one fifty off .
@highlight
Take it down to just a scroll wheel .
@highlight
in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ?
@highlight
how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .
@highlight
you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .
@highlight
So that's point three .
@highlight
and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .
@highlight
The scroll wheel is on the side .
@highlight
We're point three over at the moment .
@highlight
Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .
@highlight
Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down .
@highlight
Oh look , we're way under budget Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?
@highlight
Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .
@highlight
So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?
@highlight
No , I don't think so .
@highlight
Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .
@highlight
instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .
@highlight
But we lose the locator .
@highlight
so we still have the locate .
@highlight
We're gonna have a beep .
@highlight
It can come in the same colour as the the case .
@highlight
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .
@highlight
as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity .
@highlight
The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .
@highlight
I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .
@highlight
If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .
@highlight
But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .
@highlight
I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know .
@highlight
Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .
@highlight
the whiteboard digital pens .
@highlight
We like the pens .
@highlight
But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .
@highlight
Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .
@highlight
I mean that was fairly tight anyway , But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .
@highlight
You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .
@highlight
And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .
@highlight
Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .
@highlight
New ideas found .
@highlight
Not quite sure what about .
@highlight
Well it's it's it's pretty new , I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , costs are within budget , One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .
@highlight
Um we've evaluated the project .
@highlight
Can you put that in the project documents file ?
@highlight
And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .
@highlight
And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .
@highlight
sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .
@highlight
we've got like five minutes left .
@highlight
but if we've finished , then we've finished .
@highlight
Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .
@highlight
So I would say that's the end of that meeting .
@highlight
Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .
@highlight
Was there a questionnaire already sent ?
@highlight
Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?
@highlight
I don't see why you can't stay here , really .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

Okay, I see what Okay, so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control. Also. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wow, that's a Yea Yeah, it's fudge titanium. You know. Right, yeah. And uh Okay. Let's go for one. Yeah. So it's a good evaluation. Yeah. Mm. Mm-mm. Okay. So now, it has to fulfil the financial criterium? So, I have an Here. Um. Okay, so two. Uh-huh. Oh.

Again, I'm See it. Special colour, or it's only on the Yeah, but there is no colour here. So I put it here. How many push-button? Three or two? Is there The scroll-wheel, okay. Okay. Um That's that's not We choose this one, and not this one. Or only a scroll-wheel. You try to s No, no, no. Because how do you do to y select? Yeah, I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you Stay longer. Okay. Oops. Okay, okay. Um Mm-hmm. You you have all of these, no? Mm maybe n not this one but Yeah, so Not special colours an interest in? And buttons are not colourised? They are m Boo-hoo. It's already too expensive. Apparently. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So think of what we can cut uh here. Apparently, we have to choose one or the other. But you don't need a battery? Mm. But um it's like the hand dynamo, no? Uh it's a it's a beginning. Okay.

So, Hi Christa. Yes. Mm.. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Such a nice thing. Can I? Ho-ho. It says I will uh I'll buy it. If I if I need so. Hopefully my daughter will like it. Yes, of course. Of c course. Ah. Oh, there is a button missing. Okay. It's in option. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey, babe. Bob. Hey Bob. Okay, that's good. Oh, these are strawberries. Fruit smelling spongy titanium. I didn't know it exist, but that's great. Ha. You mean we can change the colour uh of th Yeah. Yeah okay, for the L_C_D_. Tit titanium is Uh, okay. Yeah, Bob, please. Tuesday colour. Okay. Mm-hmm. Black for Sunday. On the L_C_D_? Oh. Of course. What do you think? Strawberry sensors. Very useful. Lounge meeting. Alright. Good. So, huh. Interesting. In interesting. Mm mm. It makes sense. So uh, this is What a design. It's my turn. Mm-hmm. Let's see if this Yeah, if you meet the evaluation criterion. Yeah. So, evaluation please. So. You made a very nice prototype, and um, I think, we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it, if it fulfils our what we want to do, and things like that. So mm Uh, next slide, please. As you know, before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it. Uh, so we need to evaluate it um, try to do it in a constative way, and as much as we can. To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that, ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion, whatever it is. And seven meaning, no it doesn't fulfil at all. And we're all l going to list all the criterion. I'm going to go to that next slide, and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven. And then we are just going to have an average, which will give us the value of our uh remote control. So, maybe we can have a look at the criteria? So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important. Of course, this can be discussed, but let's let's see, so let's vote. So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle. So, what do you think, is it fancy? It is very very fancy. Or have you ever seen something like that? Yeah, of course. What do you think? Is it The weight is later. Now we're We're on the fanciness now. I think it's quite fancy. It's uh Yeah, so No it's it's one. Yeah, o one means it's, yes, a very fancy and seven mean no at all. So it's one or two. What do you think? Two? Okay. So here, two. Up. Then we have uh technology. So, what about technology? We have uh we have speech recognition, we have location based, we have L_C_D_. Change colour, I mean that's very Quite d I think it's a one for that, at least. At least a one, yeah. Robustness, uh-huh. So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away. Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again? Uh, maybe not the prototype. Let's try. Oh my god. Okay, we just lost one strawberry. So Not at all? It is Yeah. Yeah. So it's not so bad. I um uh I would say three. Yeah, that does make sense, yeah? Useful. Well, so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control? So I don't know. These buttons are uh It not clear. But you have at least uh next produce. Uh, it depends on the Okay. So but, for instance, because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control, touch screen, you cannot go to channel twenty five directly. Directly. Yeah. Oh, it's a jog dial, okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It's much longer than that that being two two five, no? Don't you think so? May not okay, we can go. That's uh You're right. That's it's less uh Yeah. But it's it's nice, because people anyway don't go there. But So what do you think for it, usefulness? Seems to be useful. Both. Yeah. Yeah. Up down or left right. Yeah. That Cool. I would say then uh Two or three? Two or three? Two. Okay, two. So size and weight. Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size, real weight? Or Because it Size is going to be that, yeah? Uh, and and It's going to be lighter, because this seems to be very heavy f I mean, for my daughter, for instance. Not sure if uh she can use it. So, should be okay. Up to three for that, because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape. Well, so colour, it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_. But um, it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case. It's a it's going to be titanium. Okay, okay. That's nice. I think it's good. Okay. Yahoo. Well y you know, it's this uh fruit and vegetable year. So Uh, I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness. Whether it's fancy or not now, it we have to decide. But this If it's Uh-huh. So, that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead.. So, it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh I suggested three. Because uh, everybody s doesn't seem to be convince, although it's quite You have good arguments. But And uh the last one is adaptive. This is not r maybe not as important as the other one, but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use? Great. Fully adaptable. That's Yeah. So you can fit into your palm, okay. That What else can we need? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well? It's fudge, yeah, yeah. Yeah, fruit titanium, yeah. Well, I if if this is if you are ready to do that, then I think it deserves a one. Okay. Now we have to do the average. Who is good in math? Okay. Two point one seven. That's nice. Two point one seven out of seven. I think we have a good good thing. Well, that's all I had to say about the evaluation. So It seems to be good, yeah. We have uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Ah-ha. So so how many batteries do we need? One battery? Good. Why two? Say no. No, ne never install. Two batteries or one? Only one. No, no. But no, no. No, no way. Yeah. You never use uh Excel? Good. It's twelve bucks. Twelve bucks. Twelve and a half, I think. Okay. Okay, electronics. So It's a simple chip? Simple chip, okay. One. Okay. One or two? One? Okay. So the case, which one uh is it in the end? Let's do a single curve. It's flat, and curved. It's curvable. Maybe there is a supplement for that, no? It's only curve? Okay, let's go. This Okay, you d We tried, we tried. So, what is it? T titanium? Mm, that's expensive. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's stick to s titan. Special colour? No because uh Yeah. Oh. So the L_C_D_ Two. Yeah. It's going to be expensive. That's all? No. Oh, I think, no it's Uh, is it a scroll wheel and pe push button, th this centre one? Or only only scroll wheel, okay. You are trying to make make up make us up. No, but you select with the two d the other two buttons, no? That's true. Yeah. Yeah. It should stay. Yeah. She's very hard on this. Special colour? Yeah. No. Special material? Yeah, buttons are the standard buttons. Yeah. It's only buttons, these. Nothing special. Okay. So we are at seventeen dot eight. No, the colour is in the L_C_D_. I no. We can just use this red. It's So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now? Uh, until we get twelve fifty. Well, if I look at what is the most expensive things, uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So that would So, but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay, we only We we win one. That's already that. Okay, let's do that. I'm not sure if this is legal. And? No. Okay, let's see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, if Click somewhere, you'll see features. Yes, it does. Maybe put minus two, so it looks uh more reasonable. Yeah, anyway No, minus two. Nobody will know. It's not recorded, is it? Okay, we're on time. Good. No, now we are exp exceeding I think. It Is it? I think we're exceeding now. We have to remove the Uh, it's better. I think they are counting uh We would prefer, yeah. Maximum is maximum. So, remove one of them. Yeah. Okay. Okay, we're uh on target. I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print. Trick. Uh, I would say it's the Russian trick, but Anyway No, they may have some their origins, strange origins No, no, no. Let's finish this meeting instead. What else? No. This is right. Okay, so finance, that's done. Are the cost under twelve? Yes. Project evaluation, good. Project process. Safe uh asse uh safe assessment. Yeah, I think we've listened to everybody. Everybody could say what they thought. And uh Yeah. When we see the results, there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership? Team-work, very strong, I would say. Team-work, no problem. Means. Whiteboard, digital pens. Yeah, I think white-board is useful. Digital pens, useful. New ideas found? Yeah. But uh Yeah, but uh then I I mus That's true. And there's uh one very important point. We're on time. Meetings finish when they have to or even before. The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing. Yeah. Yeah, we have other uh remote controls to create. Mm.. Mm, yeah. Hey, just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh. They are working on a Okay, good. I think we are great. There's no no other words for that. We are probably the best. Real Reaction is uh Yeah. Yeah. Finished? Ah, celebration. Are the costs within the budget? Of course they are. Yeah. Is the project evaluated? Yes, it is. To whom? To the whole our company? So, let's celebrate. Uh I think the meeting The meeting is over at least. So, we have to go out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Uh, here we have our prototype model. Yeah. Yeah, we have also some slides. In Yeah. Five. Him.. Experience. Explanat See this. You can Spongy. Hmm. So Yeah. This this is really flexible. You can add your buttons. Yeah. So function, mm So, as we discussed, we have to switch on switch off whenever we want. And so, we have buttons and using L_C_D_, or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_, and then do on and off. Then you ha you'll have volume control. So, you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume. And we have some L_C_D_ controls. Like, m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_, or you don't want you can just use normal button. And we have speech recognition. Here you have microphone, and then it date records your voice, and then it try to recognise. And it can also do the action. And location finder. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. You can just say, where is my remote control. Or uh, you can just give some nickname to your remote control, like Bobby. And then, it will say hi. Yeah, hi, and then you can use it. So, um our team is now fruits. Mainly strawberry. So, you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches. Material, we want to stick to titanium. We will send, we want to Yeah, or s So, we want to have simple and perfect shapes, like I shown in these phones. You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs. And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours. For the L_C_D_. With titanium it's it is silver. Yeah. Mm, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood, or s And you can have many colours on weekends. Or Huh? Ah, these are like sensors. So, after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for So, if you are vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know. Yeah. S So, any specific questions for Yeah. Yeah. Then we can discuss We can Yeah, then we can have how much for how money is left. Yeah. Fudge. Yeah. Fancy. Huh. Yeah, what's is really Uh, it's really Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. We can give at least five or six, seven. Oh, Oh. So Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh, okay. So M maybe two. Technology. Yeah. Um And we have L_C_D_. So you change colours. Useful. Yeah, yeah. It's silly. Uh, still we need to cha Yeah, it Maybe strawberry. Oh. Yeah, we can easily plug it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Useful? Yeah, Yeah. Yeah, channel. I this is volume control and channel changes. These are the main You Yeah. Yeah, and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option. So if you don't want Yeah, um yeah. Yeah. And channel. You can select. Yeah mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah mm. So, d Yeah, we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_. So so Yeah. Yeah. Up. This is jog wheel. Yeah. Um, see in L_C_D_, like you will have blocks and you select which one. Yeah. Yeah. Two, maybe. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's size al almost Yeah, because it is The weight will be bit lighter. We will s We use titanium. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Heavy. Yeah. Yeah. But sides uh, the sides should be okay.. Yeah mm. Oh. Yeah. The case is silver titanium, no? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So maybe, I think Yeah. Yeah, well Yeah. Um Yeah, well then it's bit difficult to use. Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction, too. So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours. So it's Even These buttons But it looks really not really good. I mean, the f Yeah. So these are kind of rubber things. Even if you lose one you can just put whatever. Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits, and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here, so we just Yeah, so even if you don't put, it works. But this is really fancy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three, three, six, eight, eleven. Hmm.. Yeah mm. Yeah, two one one seven, we have. So Financi Energy. Uh, we use bat One battery. Yep. Oh, we just need one, I guess. No, number is one. We need only one battery. Number, number. So we We have sample chip. Uh, like simple chip, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Four buttons at least. And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition. Yeah, one to one. Yeah, one. Yeah, I think we will go for a single curve, no? Oh, is Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh. Titanium. Yeah, well No, only one, no? Um Interface. Yes, in L_C_D_ display. Ok Yeah, an Yeah. Push-button. Scro Uh, two. Yeah. One scroll wheel. One L_C_D_ displayed. Yeah. Yeah, it's cheaper. Yeah. Only scroll wheel. Yeah mm. So It's already Ah. Y ye Yeah. Then it automatically we can just do like you feel, it goes. And it will activate Um, plus, yeah, it's price is really Special colours, yeah. Okay. Yeah, buttons and strawberries. Yeah. Special form. Uh, we have titan Yeah. Mm, hmm, I think uh because you can just go for a good colours. Yeah, and uh Yeah. Oh. Sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand is Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just remo S Yeah. Uh, no. Yeah. No, no. It's not It's not changing, no? It you don't So now on, we can increase our Still you have two more. Maybe we can use it for our party. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that No, but point five point three. Okay. Is really strict? Oh. Oh yeah. Ho Oh. Uh And we can discuss all these things in our party. Mm yeah, very much. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's really Yeah. Yeah, our team-work is really strong. Oh, we still, I guess. Hmm. Don't really. Yeah. And we also Mm. We made Mm. Hmm. Ah, we got new idea, speech recognition, location finding. New materials, new s uh this fancy strawberry design. And new tricks. Ah, very. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's We got two Good score. Oh, okay. So where we will go now? Uh, ye Will go to Italian restaurant, or Ah, okay. We can decide. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
Yes. And chocolate? Mm-hmm. Yes, and place some slides. Uh, participant three. Prototype. Uh, so this is our remote control. It's a r working prototype. You can use it now by switching all these buttons. So first, I present as we came to this perfect model, and then we'll give some technical specifications. That's well, so that's that. Please, next slide. We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA, and uh made some real good Yeah. If you can see this, and the stars are showing that. And um, s society will accept that. For sure. And making some analysis of different fruits, we choose the ultimate form, ultimate colours, and uh ultimate smell of it. S please, next slide. But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea, 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select. And it's practical. And it's still say it's for our needs, so please press something. And as I said, it's perfect. Please press it. Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device. So you can touch it with your hands. Sure. Yes. N You must say it. Yeah. Okay. Y and we got the answer. Uh, it is, yes, of course., please next slide. Um, this is a prototype. You can have a look at it, and That's all I wanted to say. Now it's technical specification by our colleague. We are still working on titanium. So, r we'll start with L_C_D_. You can ask Bob. It's Tuesday. That's location sensors. Yeah, and we can just some strawberry first. Um Oops. Let's make a party first maybe. Feel the weight. Really. Okay. Two. Two. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uh No. No. How can I say this. It's still it's still working, and your daughter got a bonus. A strawberry. You can. You go you So, the basic mode Yeah. So that's simple. The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial. With two buttons, you do this like uh volume up, volume down. Or if you go to the site, it's channel up channel down. And if you want to make to s twenty-five, you push on this. You select twenty, you select five. That's it. No. Yeah. Yeah. It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen. Like, selecting the menus. Sure, without titanium alloy, it's going to be light. Of course. Okay. Okay. And Moreover, moreover it covers it covers all the end goals. Even if it is, you know, it's very rounded, but still you got some rubber fruit here, and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that. Okay. Okay. Sure, sure, just look at it. It's full adaptable. Yeah, you can fit it into your palm, you know. Mm, It's two point one seven. No, uh you just Number. Yeah. How What what's the limit? Uh, it's it's okay that I don't know, 'cause uh it's not my field. Twelve bucks. Okay, now Mm-hmm. Check that number also. It's it's flat. It's flat. But it is flat, you Look. It's curvable, but it's not curved. Oh, okay. Mm. Mm. Well, n Why three? Why three? For buttons. No, buttons just normal. That's for buttons. But buttons are standard. Well, as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng, I mean, producing electricity from mechanical energy. So, the point is that when you take device and push the button, you produce enough energy to make electricity. Yeah, that you don't need a battery. So, it's something like hand dynamo robot. A real high-tech version of it. Okay, but l Why not. Let's do that. And I propose to So uh, about chips. Advanced chip on print, right? So, put minus one there, please. Why not? And? So, was there result? Let's have a look. Why? Oops. Yeah. Why not. Minus. Good. And a battery and a battery, yeah. Now it's fancy, let's add one instead of two. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I am not sure who was programming this calculator, you know. 'Cause uh I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number. Next slide. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. M maybe not, huh? What was the Oh yeah, what was good? Everything. What was bad? Yeah. A good leader, you know, a good leader is somewhere in the shade and Of course. Uh Not to waste time, that's important. We need time f New materials. Budget. Alright.. Okay. Yeah, it is. So, we see, we can even forecast. they propose us like celebration, everything, we could forecast it, right? You? It was you. Okay. Okay.
@highlight
Okay .
@highlight
So first , let's uh see the prototype .
@highlight
And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off .
@highlight
So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
@highlight
And we have speech recognition .
@highlight
Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .
@highlight
Oh , these are strawberries .
@highlight
Material , we want to stick to titanium .
@highlight
So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones .
@highlight
And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
@highlight
For the L_C_D_ .
@highlight
wh what are the strawberries for ?
@highlight
That's location sensors .
@highlight
let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .
@highlight
so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven .
@highlight
One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is .
@highlight
what do you think , is it fancy ?
@highlight
So here , two .
@highlight
Up .
@highlight
Then we have uh technology .
@highlight
d I think it's a one for that , at least .
@highlight
Robustness , uh-huh .
@highlight
It's um robust , yeah .
@highlight
Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?
@highlight
The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .
@highlight
And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
@highlight
It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?
@highlight
we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ .
@highlight
So It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .
@highlight
Okay , two .
@highlight
So size and weight .
@highlight
Up to three for that , Colour and shape .
@highlight
The case is silver titanium , no ?
@highlight
And what about the strawberries on the top ?
@highlight
We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .
@highlight
So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .
@highlight
Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and I suggested three .
@highlight
And uh the last one is adaptive .
@highlight
Okay .
@highlight
Let's go for one .
@highlight
Now we have to do the average .
@highlight
Two point one seven .
@highlight
So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?
@highlight
We need only one battery .
@highlight
We have sample chip .
@highlight
And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
@highlight
Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , Titanium .
@highlight
How many push-button ?
@highlight
Two .
@highlight
The scroll-wheel , okay .
@highlight
One L_C_D_ displayed .
@highlight
So we are at seventeen dot eight .
@highlight
So think of what we can cut uh here .
@highlight
I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .
@highlight
to make electricity .
@highlight
So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , We we win one .
@highlight
So , put minus one there , please .
@highlight
I'm not sure if this is legal .
@highlight
Okay , we're uh on target .
@highlight
Project evaluation , good .
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
See mm how Are we a good team ?
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
Is there enough room for creativity ?
@highlight
Yeah , yeah .
@highlight
Team-work , very strong , I would say .
@highlight
I think white-board is useful .
@highlight
Digital pens , useful .
@highlight
Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding .
@highlight
New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .
@highlight
And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser .
@highlight
I'm not convince .
@highlight
Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .
@highlight
Apparently , we have to choose one or the other .
@highlight
if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker .
@highlight
Are we supposed to cut things out now ?","```

ES2005a.json,"Alright so twenty five. So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic. So uh Mm. But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features. For sure. Yeah, yeah. Right. Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this? 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily. Right. Okay. Wait for emails? Hmm.
Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah the universal ones. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, it's about that. Mm. Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black. As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least. Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things? Because we always lose our remote control. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then you lose it, yeah. Kind of um, maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah. No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but Okay. So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh no,. Sorry it's okay. Okay, cool.
Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros. So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to put into. Yeah, yeah. Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so? And that's quite a lot for a remote control. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. The the keyrings, yeah yeah. Okay, that's cool. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. So, we're looking for 'Kay. We're Sorry, carry on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty. Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate. So you do the looking around at other remote controls. Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever. And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach. Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive. Uh. And you look at competition and design. Cool. So we have uh Um. Okay, groovy. And no doubt we'll get um Sorry. We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well. Okay. I shall I can't imagine these are worth much. Okay. Fashion into electronic. Okay.
Slim. Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market. So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player, M_P_ three player like any electronic devices. They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this. Yeah. Yep. Uh. Hmm.
@highlight
Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros .
@highlight
so twenty five .
@highlight
So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy .
@highlight
I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things Yeah the universal ones .

Yeah .

IS1009d.json,"Well hi everyone again. Um like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go. Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_. It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. It should have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. Um. Should be child friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose. Um that's right. But uh her very f personal favourite really she, she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote. The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant. She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode transistor, resonator, and if possible a rechargeable battery. Uh and of course a circuit board. And how it would works, you press the button, the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider. She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases. The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does. To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on. Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home. Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. She feels that's really what people want today. And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong, and should have buttons. And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting. Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. What kind of button? Menu? Uh menu th menu, uh one one. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes the buttons are all raised, right? Are raised, mm-hmm. Right. Or have two hands to operate it, yeah. Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah, mm-hmm. So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter. Well, I have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what? Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it Yeah. But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols, text or something so that people kn That's right. Okay, yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm. Right, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Now what, what are our special features for the marketing? That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual And then, and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use. You know. Colours. Mm-hmm. Cutest. Yeah. Okay, now uh having said that No, now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done. Now we're gonna talk about financing. Well, there is a production evaluation. Is that you? But that's after the financing. See? Fi see? Um. Okay, we had looks and voice recognition. Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is. Okay uh energy source we say that's battery, right? Okay, now. So we I guess we use one. What? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected. Well, that's nice. She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would It doesn't work. Hmm. Oh, okay yeah, okay, let's see. Okay, one, okay. Oh go away. Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. Uh electronics, simple chip on print? Is that's what we're using? One of those? Come on. Okay, one. Uh regular chip on print. No. That's all we need, the one case, uncurved flat, single curved, double curved. Double curved? One of those? Case materi s supplements. Plastic we said, right? Uh wood, rubber? Uh but, yes but That's just for the case material, so special colours though, we having that, right? And then we have to interface push buttons. Scroll wheel, no. Integrated scroll wheel, L_C_ display? Button. No. Uh, button supplement special colour? Special form? And special material, rubber, wood, yes. Okay. Total seven point six whatever that means. That's the price. Mm? Eight, eight point two. That's hmm? Eight point two, right? So, we looks like we are well within budget. Okay. I guess I should save this I suppose, huh? Oops. Uh-huh huh huh. I just tried that. My documents, computer. My compu Ah oh here it is, yes. Okay, fine. Save. Okay good, so that's the good news. We gonna be popular. Um. So that uh I think financing was pretty simple. Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation. You wanna go to the next slide? Okay. Um I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that, too. Eight, eight twenty, yes. I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished, as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much. So um we just have to beware of that. I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that. Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features, okay? So to beware of that. You wanna go to this next slide, marketing expert? I dunno. Yes it is. Mm-hmm. Oh. Why? Wh why you need that up? I think you can make it there. Yes I think uh shape is one. You you gave it a four. Um, I dunno. I think I would give it at least a two. Colour uh I One. I I like the colours. One. Uh, I think I would give it a two. Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um I'll give it a three. Uh. Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Um. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't, with this particular item, we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things. Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser. Um. So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process? Uh, um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created? Uh I think personally I think uh I'm pretty happy. Um an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? Uh And I think team work I think was very very good, I think we really yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh I think we are we happy with the means we used? We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things. Yes, we could. Uh, it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit. Yes, I think so, I think absolutely, and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier. Um did we new did we find new ideas? I think we did. I think we we did, uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here. Are the costs within budget? Yes, yes. Uh is the project evaluated? Yes. Um then celebration. So I I thank you all very much. Um, I think this was very good and um I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible. Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view. So, thank you. I always get it on here, but getting it off is Ah yes we have time later but we don't
Hello Mm-hmm. And she was challenged on that point Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. You used to have all the buttons Oh that's good, no, that's nice and friendly. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Menu button. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of the screen. Mm, mm-hmm. The next channel in the numeric pattern, or Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, well um what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb, that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand, yeah? The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around, turn it upside down, move it up, up and down, I really like that. You really did a good job on that, my little designers. Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. That's that's a really good good thing. Yeah, that's great. Mm-hmm. The colour's very attractive. Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute and these mm-hmm On both sides they're mute? So you can push either one? Okay. And this brings the menu up on the screen? This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are Okay. F f okay. Right, very good. Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell. Okay and now I'm supposed to yeah. Yeah. Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent. Symbols on it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, 'kay, mm. Mm-hmm. For the snail, yeah, mm-hmm, we have the snail shell. He goes right back into his shell. Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would, that would really work. So I think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range. Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. I think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance. We're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block. So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition. I think those are the two things to push. The look and the voice recognition. They're gonna be our two selling points. I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I? Okay. Ah, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something. No? Yeah, that's me. Oh, okay. Sorry, sorry. Mm-mm. That's right. Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes? Or Well. I guess it's double curved. Mm-hmm. Rubber, because we're gonna have the soft buttons. Oh okay, the mm-hmm, mm' kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all, right? Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, I'll take my file down so you can bring it up. 'Kay should be able to get it now. 'Kay, why don't you move just to the next slide right away. Yeah right away. Okay, well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of. We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few. And show the the prototype to consumer research groups, we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any. So we have to get some input from those people. And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it, we think it's good, we're gonna get behind it and sell it. Um, next slide please. Okay, now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype. I wanted the shape to be biomorphic, I didn't want anything with angles and all square, I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that. The size is small, the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted. We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible, we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped, even though it's gonna be hard plastic, it feels good in your hand so that's nice. And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it. So paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel um and the shape, that's what people are gonna get in the store. They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it. Um so they'll be our main selling points. So um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. Okay, so um the shape um I think is a a one. That's really, really excellent shape. The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the, for the marketing, these aren't i in how I feel. I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven. I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors. And our colour I think is great. The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there. And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible. And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality, obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality. So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it. Yes. Ah. Well, um we had what, eight eight euros twenty as our cost? And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend. Mm-hmm. Well um that's Mm-hmm. Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price, the the the problem is quality. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us. And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway. As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products. Uh, well I isn't this my last slide? Maybe. Go ahead. I think that was my last slide, yeah. Um. Mm okay. And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard. Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, so if you put my last slide back up there. I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that, um. Hmm? Well because I can't remember what I put on there. Okay. Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here. Mm 'kay. You ready. So now we're all supposed to say what we think. Um okay so on shape I gave it a one. Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst. Um what do you think the shape is? One, okay, and Be Betsy? Okay, uh-huh one, okay. And how about on size? On size I gave it a four, yeah, I feel it's just average. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay you're the designer, of course you wanna give it a one. Um and then how about how we doing on colour? Colour, I gave it a one. I really like all those nice bright, warm colours. One. One, one, one, okay. And how about the feel? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand. Okay, I gave it a three, two, yeah? Three. Two, okay. And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Two, okay. Three? Okay. Well, um. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product. Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe, heaven forbid, having another meeting. But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product. Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate? Mm-hmm. Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons. And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control. Maybe we can put that all on one button. Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm pretty happy with it too, yeah um, it's something I think I can market. Yeah. I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah, we didn't use that enough. Mm-hmm. And we used the slide because it was better positioned. Mm I think that's true mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think we were we were very good, yeah, mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, yes. Celebration. Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Watch I I have my cord behind you here. Okay. But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time, whenever we felt we were finished. It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace. Oh, there we go.
Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Uh so this is our what uh we have made. This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful. Uh and also compact in shape. Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily. Yeah, oops, sorry. Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah. Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it. And then um uh for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared. And and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina. Tell, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah of course, and also Hmm. Yeah. Yeah we can Text. Text that we can have on the case itself, we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. So it is yeah, yeah shell. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, of course, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah. This is a Yeah. Yeah. I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think that's the price. Maybe it is it just n Yeah. AMI. AMI should for Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Eight twenty so We have um four euros, yeah Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, still. Yeah. Included, yeah. Hmm, hmm Yeah, even my yeah, shape is one. Yeah, even I think it is one. It's quite small. Yeah, one. Uh maybe two, yeah. Uh three, mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe we can yeah, include some more buttons and uh um yeah features. We can make the buttons few buttons smaller. Uh I think they are quite big, so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely, yeah, two mu mute buttons. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Even I'm happy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, many. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. Do we do we have some time left? Uh you have Oh, alright.
Hello. Designer. Yes. Yeah. Just the look like, the button part I'll explain. Okay. Now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote. Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared. Now uh we have included the switch on and off button. Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model. Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels. We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. Menu button. Yes, menu At the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour, sharpness, brightness of this uh picture. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. Now this is uh a special, special feature which we have included. Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel, if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button. No, swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap, this button. Yes. And at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly. So this is our proposed model. Now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective. Yes, yes. Yes. Mm. Abs okay. No, these the front buttons which are here, are the mute buttons. Yes, yes. Yes. Pardon me? This is the menu yes, yes. A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes, and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels. Scroll up or scroll down the channels. Yes, it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. Yes, which can be easily recognised. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape. Yes, yes. Yes, snail shell. Yes. Mm-hmm. Y Yes Yes. Yes. Yes. Single curve? Mm. Plastic. Is this for the case? Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Speci Yes Yes d we do have special form. One two three four five six seven eight nine Nine points, okay, yes. Okay. On the desktop. Okay. Fee selling. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes, yes. Yeah mm. Worse, okay. One. One. One. Yes. I'll give three. Two. We can always improve, yes. Yes, features. Yes. Voices. Yes. Yes. And maybe Yes. Yes, yes you've done a good job. Whiteboard more, yes, yes. Yes. No. Yes. Cel celebration yes, yes. Thank you. Okay. They say it's forty minutes. Okay.
@highlight
like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .
@highlight
Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote .
@highlight
The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue .
@highlight
She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .
@highlight
uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore .
@highlight
The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching .
@highlight
And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , should be trendy design , compact and strong , This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
@highlight
Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive it's blue in colour Uh and also compact in shape .
@highlight
Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Now uh we have included the switch on and off button .
@highlight
Then we have included one to nine buttons We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume .
@highlight
Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
@highlight
We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button .
@highlight
And then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly .
@highlight
what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place .
@highlight
The colour's very attractive .
@highlight
Yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
@highlight
and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
@highlight
A shell shape .
@highlight
I think voice recognition is our big selling point I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance .
@highlight
I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ?
@highlight
No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done .
@highlight
Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something .
@highlight
Well , there is a production evaluation .
@highlight
But that's after the financing .
@highlight
Okay now on the financing we bring up the Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need .
@highlight
Uh electronics , simple chip on print ?
@highlight
I guess it's double curved .
@highlight
And then we have to interface push buttons .
@highlight
Eight , eight point two .
@highlight
looks like we are well within budget .
@highlight
Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
@highlight
And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype .
@highlight
And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it .
@highlight
Okay , so um the shape um I think is a a one .
@highlight
And our colour I think is great .
@highlight
so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .
@highlight
Um I just realised one thing .
@highlight
In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .
@highlight
I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty .
@highlight
So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
@highlight
Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , uh one being good and seven being the worst .
@highlight
Yes I think uh shape is one .
@highlight
And how about on size ?
@highlight
I think I would give it at least a two .
@highlight
Colour , I gave it a one .
@highlight
One , one , one , okay .
@highlight
And how about the feel ?
@highlight
I'll give three .
@highlight
Uh maybe two , And the next is functionality I'll give it a three .
@highlight
It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product .
@highlight
Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity .
@highlight
Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?
@highlight
We can always improve , yes .
@highlight
so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case .
@highlight
If we want to have more features than that .
@highlight
Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .
@highlight
maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
@highlight
Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here personally I think uh I'm pretty happy .
@highlight
and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
@highlight
I think you've done a good job , Miss leader .
@highlight
Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah .
@highlight
Mm-hmm .
@highlight
Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , I think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here .
@highlight
So I I thank you all very much .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

Okay, here's the agenda for the meeting. After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary, take the meeting minutes. And we're gonna have three presentations, one from each of you. Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements. Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control. And then we're gonna close up the meeting. And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes. Okay. First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting. First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control. And then we're going to determine the technical functions, what is the effect of the apparatus, what actually is it supposed to do, what do people pick up the remote and use it for. And then lastly we're going to determine its working design, how exactly will it perform its functions, that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute, 'cause it looks like you're making some notes. 'Kay. Oh, well let's go ahead and, back, previous. So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you, on your research that you just did. Who would like to start us off? 'Kay. Okay. Um do you have a PowerPoint or no? Okay. Oh. Save it in the project documents. Okay. Mm-mm-mm. This one? Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Ready. Alright. Very good presentation. Thank you. You speak with such authority on the matter. Okay. Who would like to um follow that one up? Now, that we've discussed Okay. Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay. Functional requirements. 'Kay. Alright. Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements. Okay, what do you m Oh, I'm sorry. What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user, like they have to press the buttons. Okay. Oh, right. The buttons. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It works. Ready for the next slide? Hmm. It's okay. It's very important. Could be, yeah. Oh. I think that's a pretty good guess though. Yeah. It's okay. Okay. Next slide? User-friendly. And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say, channel five, and the thing would go to channel five? Okay. Oh, that'd be lovely. Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it Mm. Oh, yeah, that's true. We could definitely include that if we wanted to. If it's within our price. Okay. Are we ready for our last presentation, Amber? Okay. There we go. 'Kay. Oh my bad. Okay. Ready? That's okay. Hmm. So this would be the front? So the red would be the front of the remote though, right? Okay. The l the light up kind of Yeah. Hmm. It'd probably be lighting up the key too, right? 'Kay. The buttons. Okay. Yeah, definitely. 'Kay nex R Ready? 'Kay, any p 'Kay? Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though, you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button, you think. Anything else? Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay, let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include, let's um wrap up this one, and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint, 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier. Wait, come back. Alright. Sorry, let's go through this. Alright. Here we go. New product requirements. First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote. We're trying not to over-complicate things. So no D_V_D_, no TiVo, no stereo. It's not gonna be multi-functional. Hey. And we th need to promote our company more, so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote. We're trying to get our name out there in the world. Okay. And you know what teletext is? in States we don't have it, but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather, kind of sports, it's very um bland looking, it's just text on the screen, not even Yeah, just black with just text. Yeah. Kind of. Yeah it's the whole screen. So anyway Right. Right. But it's becoming out-dated now, because of the Internet. Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news, and we have twenty four hour news channels now too, so Those are our new product requirements. Alright. Mm-hmm. Yes. It's part of the logo. Okay. What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions, definitive that we can all agree on, about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting. So. Alright. Whatever. Okay. So our target group is You mentioned um older people? Would it just be universal for everyone, you think? Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it. I mean they want something user-friendly, so Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so we want um for our target group would we say, I mean, young and old, all age ranges, all um, not kids obviously, right? Or kids? Okay, so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about technic technical um specifications, like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote? Okay. Right, okay. So so they need no technical experience to operate Okay. And we also need to determine the specific functions of this, just to get it all out on paper. So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_, needs to change the channel, turn on and off, just basic simple stuff like this. So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes. Mm-hmm, volume. Right. And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down. Correct, because people only use ten percent. 'Kay. Hey, what else? Um. I think so. What do you A finding kind of device or Yeah, ho homing device. Mm 'kay. Okay. Right. Hmm. Would that add to our costs at all, I wonder? Right. Okay. I I think we can make a decision about that later. Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss. So that would include battery source Power source rather. Is it going to have a charger, or is it going to be run strictly off batteries? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition, if we want that. Mm. You could um we could hook it up. Oh. Mm-hmm. And if and if we introduced it when they're this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has Right. Yeah. and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device, too. If we said, find remote, locate remote, or something. A certain phrase then it could beep. I dunno. Just throwing it out there. Well Okay, anything else we wanna discuss? Um. How how, yeah, how would you leave those out? Unless you could say the channel. Yeah, that's true. And also remember that in this day in age we need, you know, like a hundred button, too. I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty. So I couldn't whenever I got cable, I had to get a new T_V_. Mm. get your own remote, or digital cable. 'Kay. Um. I guess, we're gonna discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget. Um. 'Kay. And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo. I'm guessing. And the R_R_. We could just have the logo in yellow, or maybe a yellow light for the keys. Right. So we've simplified, we don't need all those um play, fast-forward, rewind, or no menu buttons. So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off, volume, mute, channel up and down, um the numbers Yeah. Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything. Which one is yours, technical functions or functional requirement? Okay. The T_V_. I think that that's fine just for the T_V_. I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff? Hmm. Couldn't we do that all through one button, something, a menu button, that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says, you know, audio, video, whatever, language, you know? For the menus. That's true. Something that looks mayb you know. Y right, right right right. That one? Right. In the middle perhaps. Yep. good. Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting? Okay. get out of here. Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next. Mm. Alright. After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail. And then we're gonna have lunch break. And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time. Um I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder, if you'd like to review them. And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well. Um here's what we're each going to do. The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept, um U_I_D_ the user interface concept, and you're going to do some trend watching. 'Kay. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. And if anybody has anything they would like to add? No? Okay, well, this meeting is officially over. Thank you all.
Did you send it? Okay. Great. We only use ten per cent of our brains. yeah. Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is? Yeah, I'm just trying to move it. 'Kay. I think it should be there, working design. 'Kay. Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one, 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating. Uh okay, so method method of our design, I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this. We need a power source, we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional. Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip. Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart. Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions. I wouldn't think so, 'cause we could probably get it from like, in bulk, from a a newer company. And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap. Um yep, nothing here. Um power source, I figured, batteries, 'cause they're easily available. Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s, sometimes three. Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself. Um a large on-off button, demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people, so a large on-off button would probably be good. Selection button for various entertainment devices, so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system. Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits, sorry, universal application again, something that'll allow us to skip over between devices, and that's kinda it. Uh this is my fifty second design. Power source over here. We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it, and you're gonna need the switch. Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness, um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device. Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb, so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to. This is just like a rough schematic. So this is the internal workings. Yeah. Yeah, so you don't have to stare at that infra-red, 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently, you have to actually stare at that bulb and go, okay, when I push this button, is it working? We can skip that whole thing. Yep. So you can put it in the dark. Yeah, that's it. I think that that's a good idea, because you know that's one of the most important buttons. Okay. You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so It's the entire screen is just running information at random. Seemingly. Okay. So, do we have to include the company colour within that? Mm well, even if we kept the regular standard size of remote, if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra, 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them, then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons. Most of them will intuitively pick it up though. how 'bout little to no, because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no. Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily? And like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach, how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it? What if we gave it a charger? And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger, and if you d leave your phone somewhere, you push the button to find it, and it finds th the phone beeps for you. It's useful for the remote phone. Yeah. Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually. Yeah. I think people would find that too foreign. It's when we get satellite. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment, so R_ the double R_. Or is the l Yeah, yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge. Mm-hmm. I had something, but I forgot.
Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or I can go. Yeah, you should run it. Mm yes. Yes, okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab, and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire, and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls. Seventy five percent think they're ugly. Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more, which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier, and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there, but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple. So that's really what we need to do. And we need we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be high-tech looking. So Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot. Yeah. I don't know. It's from my uh research. My team wasn't very clear. That's okay. I I think it's like the engineering versus user, whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there, because they only use ten percent of the buttons really. Good point. It's a necessary evil. Mm-hmm. And so people say that they typically lose it, as you yourself know, because you probably lose your remote control all the time, much like any small appliance like a cellphone, and they we need something simple, because most people, well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one, and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote, but I mean they do need to be able to identify it, and R_S_I_, I'm not very sure what that is. Yes, it is important for the remote control world. Sh Uh possibly. Uh yeah, that's what my web site said, I don't know. Yeah, I would assume so. I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts. But also s so the channel, the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used, but those are the definitely the top ones. Yes. And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design, but it it really needs to be simple. So saying from y your slide, your presentation, the engineering versus the user-specified remotes, I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly. Where the engineering ones, the boxes, tend to make it look more complicated than it really is. Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it. And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers, so even though we need a small number of buttons, we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player, a TiVo, what what exactly are we using it for, as well as the age range. So we need a hip, but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product. And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it, and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it. I guess so, yeah. Yeah, I guess we can interpret it like, we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme. Oh that's fine. What exactly is a smart chip? So what exactly we are looking at, is this like the front of the remote? Oh okay. Like that we know the battery's working. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, and that's good. We should make it glow in the dark. Mm 'kay. I think we should. Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design, sorry, um. I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote, 'cause most remotes have small square buttons, I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles. What is it? Like running along the bottom? Wait, is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something? So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching? Okay. No, kids need to know how to use a remote, I would think. They gotta change between Disney Channel, Cartoon Network. Yeah, I think we need it all. Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person. Yeah. And channel. Yeah. Those are the most important ones. Yeah. Sure, yeah. I need we we need a like homing device. Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech. Do you think people'll really go for that though? Because Yeah. I would think so, because you'd have to develop a base. Hmm. Right. Do w Well, th there's the people who desire speech recognition, there's the different demog demographics have different desires, I don't know if you guys ge It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black, but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition. So basically older people don't really care. It's really the people twenty five to thirty five. I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though. They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and stuff. Right. So Right. Yeah. Wait, on the remote itself? Well, we definitely need those. Yeah. You definitely need Wait. I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish. Or put like stripes, oh yeah, yellow lights. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, audi audio settings and screen settings, we need those like audio settings mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness, colour, or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself? Yeah, 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that. It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff, and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful. So we need up, down, and side-to-side buttons. Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Such as, yeah, the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one. Ooh, I just got an idea for a design.
I don't mind going first. Yeah, it's in the should be in the m Project. You know you could you could do it yourself actually. Put it in Project Documents, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Um well, the function of a remote control, as what uh we've been informed, is basically to send messages to the television set, for example, switch it on, switch it off, go to this channel, go to channel nine, turn the volume up, etcetera. Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers, you know, zero to nine, so you can move to a channel, the power button on slash off, the channel going up and down, volume going up and down, and then mute, a mute function. And then functions for V_H_S_, D_V_D_, for example, play, rewind, fast-forward, stop, pause, enter. And enter would be for like, you know, the menus. And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_, whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of menus. And we can decide if that's what we want,, um if we want to include that on the remote, if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself, for example. These are two examples. Um and you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons, and I don't know if you can read it, but it says, step, go to, freeze, um slow, repeat, program, mute, and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example. And then on the right, it's a lot more simpler, it's got volume, it's got the play the like circle set, which is play, rewind, but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu. So you have functions that are d uh duplicating. And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject, and the power button. So that gives you two different kinds, a more complex and more simple version. Okay. And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include, and how simple, complex it should be? And what functions it needs to complete. Uh, what are needed to complete insulation process, 'cause, you know, that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing, when you set it up it should be set to go, but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place. So that's it. Mm. Left. Wait. And that meaning what? Okay. Right. Only use ten percent of the buttons. Lost. S Wait, is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something? Like Channel, volume, power. It's like if you're holding it to just say, where are you, and thing beeps, you know. Yeah. It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do. You know like go to the base. Yeah. Working design. Help me. Well, how much extra would the additional chip be? Is that gonna push us over our production costs? Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_, but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it's sort of like a reassurance. Yeah. Just Well, should it be larger buttons in general, you know like uh the examples that I had, they were swi quite small. So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons? Ovals. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I know. Yeah, it's like black, black and white kind of It'll give you the sports. Except the entire screen. You can pick sports, you can pick the news, you entertainment, you know it's like Yeah. Company colour being yellow. Mm-hmm. It's gonna make it nicer. Yeah. We should go for the lowest denominator. High school educated. Well it's channel, on-off button, volume, mute. Um. Oh right yeah okay. Tracking. But you got a base. Well, if you have the base, you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery. Yeah. Well, then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic. Well Well, then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television, in the base, or in the actual remote, 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand, why you just gonna speak to the remote, whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it. Still fifteen minutes. Um. Well, do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine? Can we conceive of leaving them out? Yeah, like you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, zero. Well, I don't know, I mean, if you can like well I don't know, if there's just a way of leaving them out? The colour being yellow? And how do we Can't make it entirely Well if you have like a Hang on. If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it, just like yellow with the R_R_. Right, yeah. Two examples. Yeah. Oh, it's a Yeah. Well, the other option is sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away, you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much, but occasionally you will use. and so it's like I don't well, I don't know. Right. Well, that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons. Channel is just up and down. And then add a Yeah. So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed, including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu.

This is the functional design meeting .
@highlight
Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting .
@highlight
After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .
@highlight
And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you .
@highlight
First we need to determine the user requirements First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting .
@highlight
And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .
@highlight
whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .
@highlight
And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .
@highlight
These are two examples .
@highlight
Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ?
@highlight
Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .
@highlight
okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , Seventy five percent think they're ugly .
@highlight
And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking .
@highlight
So What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .
@highlight
I I think it's like the engineering versus user , and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .
@highlight
And so people say that they typically lose it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .
@highlight
Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?
@highlight
Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .
@highlight
And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it We could definitely include that if we wanted to .
@highlight
'Kay .
@highlight
Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .
@highlight
We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional .
@highlight
Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .

Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .
@highlight
Like that we know the battery's working .
@highlight
We should make it glow in the dark .
@highlight
Well , should it be larger buttons in general , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .
@highlight
New product requirements .
@highlight
First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote .
@highlight
so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .
@highlight
But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .
@highlight
Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?
@highlight
Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it .
@highlight
so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range we we need a like homing device .
@highlight
and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .
@highlight
And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .
@highlight
Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .
@highlight
If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .
@highlight
It's really the people twenty five to thirty five .
@highlight
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .
@highlight
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .
@highlight
We could just have the logo in yellow , The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching .
@highlight
or maybe a yellow light for the keys .
@highlight
If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .
@highlight
So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .
@highlight
Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ?
@highlight
Well , we definitely need those .
@highlight
So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , or no menu buttons .
@highlight
So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?
@highlight
I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ .
@highlight
you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .
@highlight
So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed ,","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

ES2006c.json,"Does that mean like a wind-up one? A wind-up remote. You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike, and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_. Yeah, and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing, 'cause that's just Yay. Did you say wool? Wood. Oh right.. Yeah, you'll understand why when we get to my presenta. Sony. Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it. Mm. No it's got its little camera in there, plug it in. 'S a Ugly. Yeah, you can't Oh, it's like the iPod. G yeah, no, you can. It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse, and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah. It is You just go round and it is a bit weird at first, but it's actually very like fast. I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower, so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff. Do you know, if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_, then it's a lot faster than the wheel, but you've got a lot less control over it. Okay, I've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah. Cool. Fabulous. Okay, cool. Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future. Okay. Right. Now, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So, I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really. Um, you know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different, so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for. And um, yeah it wants to look fancy, fancy look and feel. So Yeah, yeah. Mm. Depends how fast your television runs, really, don't don't you think? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait, and then it comes, so i it actually takes quite a long time. And if you get the number in wrong, then it's a bit of a pain, so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit. You know? Yeah. And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on, and you could just see that on the remote rather than Yeah. But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone, you know, like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched. So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control, you know or like a minimalist remote control. So you got your buttons one to nine, your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it, you flip it open and, yeah. Yeah, so that kind of decides your whole chip thing. Okay? Cool. Okay, apparently, fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration. Sorry, I discovered clip art. Um so these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, curviness. Do you know? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know? Yeah, bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there, because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand. Um yeah, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Um Yeah, but I mean y you have to Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber. Yeah, yeah. If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there, you could just bounce it up and down. Yeah. Um so yeah, um okay. Yeah, yeah. You have to have a certain element of flatness, I think. It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it, you know, it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically. No, I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight, but it's curvy, so. Besides, you have four sides to a thing, so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and, you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing? Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_, which I think is where it came from. But no, my research didn't tell me anything, which is why we have all the pictures, 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time. Okay, cool. Uh combine style with a level of functionality, um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function. Okay? It's about the practicality of it really, isn't it? You know? I mean if I can't imagine a m wooden remote control. Well it's not very cleanable either, do you know. It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table, but for a remote control, you know. And splinters and stuff and It just m doesn't make any sense, I think is the thing with wood. You have to have some push-buttons, don't you? G yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven. Yeah. Yeah. G yeah, I would think buttons, yeah. It's it's the I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote, and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible, but, you know, I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_, I think is the the the issue there. E either or G yeah. I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel, so you have to decide whether you you know, you want to be going so fast or not. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber, on the basis that it's spongy, then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work. Yeah, but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side. You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and Or maybe like interchangeable cases. 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel, but I have like a you know, obviously my iPod's not made of rubber, but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour, theoretically, to match my outfit. Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now. Yeah. That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though. Yeah, but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours, do you know? So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it. So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or If solar panels with the rubber. Yeah, okay, so we lose that I think. Yeah. It's just a gimmick. Yeah, sure j Sorry, do you want me to What does um I_C_S_ mean? Okay, cool. So it's advanced integrated circuits? Imagine it would be inside. So um actually that could like really cut down your thing, so you've got your outside, which is like minimalist, and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel, which you can incorporate buttons into. Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the You've maybe got, you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel, and four of the buttons are in the wheel, and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel, yeah. Cool, I'm gonna go and sit on my own. I know, I'm hated. I've got a bit tangled up in all this.
Excellent. So um I sent you the agenda, it was on the in the project documents. I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway, it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time, so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with, so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts, so that's we need to know about the components' properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching. Okay. Um, do you wanna start again? Let me we've got forty minutes. You haven't made a PowerPoint, okay. Mm-hmm. Let's hope the pen holds out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And charging their remote, yeah. Uh yeah. Mm-hmm. For a remote, 'cause you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wood, wood. A fluffy remote. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board, so that if we need to you can sit down, but just we might need you to leap up. What are you, PowerPoint, or Okay. Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand? Some sort of radiation? Yeah. Right, interface concept. That's fine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh, hi yeah. It's like the like you said, no? The scroll scroll wheel. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Okay, straight to trends, and then we can discuss it all at once. The project documents. Excellent. If you two could both do that as well, in case we need to refer to it. Here it comes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. That's over on the interface, if if you could put Yeah. And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing. Mm-hmm. Mm. It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen, so if you're watching something Yeah. Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure. Mm. Yeah. And then you can flip it open. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Right. Yeah, and possibly even uneven, like not not symmet yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Something a bit squishy and Yeah, and it'd help if you drop it, it protects it as well. To some degree. Uh-huh. Or if we want to use the the latex, then we have to go with one of the other um power things. From from bouncing it. You can have it as like a little ball to bounce, that flips open. Mm yeah. Uh-huh. Mm. Yeah, 'cause the Yeah. Dunno. Nothing to open them. Anything else? What've we got? Okay, so. Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. Yeah, rub off some of those. Yeah, it's not that's not streamlined and sexy, having a having a wind up. I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs. Pr presumably if they're suggesting it, then we could use it. I'd I'd keep it on. We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable. Mm. Mm. Yeah, and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences, I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Just for fast Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it yeah L_ L_C_D_. Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_? Buttons. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what you guys are gonna do next, so if we put down the key um things that we want. Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say. Yeah. Hmm. But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing, effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you folded it in half. Th that would be on one side, uh-huh. No, I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. That's right, that's what they're after. Mm-hmm. I guess. Bananas. Mm-hmm. Green. Yeah. We need the advanced yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That was the We can't have solar panels with rubber, so. Shall we go for if we're going for rubber, we think uh on as our case, and then Yeah. We've got five more minutes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in, but if it's Yeah. It's from the company, so Yeah. Okay. And the case is curved on one side, but then flat flat, so it's flipped into each other. Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer? Just so we can Nothing, it's right, I'm just There we go. Uh oh now I've gone too far. Yeah. We're on our way. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber. We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel, and we're incorporating voice recognition. That's our overall concept, and it's gonna look sort of vegetable, and be in bright vegetable colours. I think it's on the Mm-mm. Yeah. On the Mm-hmm. In the centre, yeah, sure. Okay, so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design, which I'll presume he'll work out what that means. Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation. And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach. Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it. Y ah nobody wants to talk to you. Unplug yourself. I dunno, maybe I would car
So what was what was this k ka Okay. Mm-hmm. Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control, yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Um I have some PowerPoint, yeah. Oh. 'Kay. Okay. Okay. Um to be honest actually, I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time, I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So um yeah, this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again. Okay. So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well, and colour, and so on. Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant. Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So some findings um um. So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. Um okay, and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay, some of them are here. Um well the picture is not very clear, but as you can see, there are actu oi, oh oh oh, sorry for that. 'S go back. Ah, no, please. Okay, so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Um okay. So let's carry on with this. Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used, uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh. Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait, no this is not the one. Okay, there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it. Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display. Um s another new development is a scroll button, which was also th also already mentioned. And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be. Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition, but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker, there can be a um pre-programmed answer, for example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever. So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include. No no, the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment, I'll I'll show you. I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons. Look, this one here. But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round, it's like you press this or this or Uh-huh. Mm. Uh Okay, and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time. It it has to be small, simple. Okay, we decided to include voice recognition, so to have the standard uh major buttons like on, off, um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen. Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button, I thought it could be for for voice like, I dunno, it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something. There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control. So yeah, that's uh that's it. Yep, yeah. Mm-hmm. So it could be like a rubbery yeah, uh-huh. Thanks Yeah uh-hum yeah. Yeah it's yeah. N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and The wood thing. Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in, so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. U yeah wood is not really yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, in the case of remote control not really. Yeah, but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you? Yeah, so for channel numbers but But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah, it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control, but if you do want to use L_C_D_, then you flip it open, but it's it it's more time-consuming. Yeah. No, no, I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers, because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Um Yeah, I would say buttons, because it's yeah. I Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah, about the spinning wheel. So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing, it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah, yeah, in that case. Ah, but I mean you can Yeah, I um I think so too, I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons, rubber buttons, but then Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey and black or something, or Yeah, does Yeah. Banana's yellow, yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm. And the buttons as well, I think. Yeah. Yeah, but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Uh-huh. So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_, or would it be on the outer Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with we need to
Right. Okay. Right s so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation, yeah, I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. Um mm, okay, so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that. Okay, so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay, so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote, right? If you open it, you have a circuit board here, right, and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here, which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board, and this is th the most important point here, uh everything else is kind of Okay, so if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like. So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes, the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation, which goes goes out through there. So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make, you can ge get them printed as you want to, so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost, the way we want to have. Right? So that's the important point here, so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries, I'll start with the battery, right? So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells, yeah? Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes, right? So. And dynamos. Um yeah, yeah. So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this, but these are the different things that the company makes, so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company, they'll be eas uh cheaper, uh all these options. So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good option. The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking. But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes. But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company. Environment friendly. Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases, they can be flat, they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat, and they can be curved with on both the sides. These are the three options, right? Um Yeah, would it be flat on both the sides, would be curved from one side, or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available, um like it can be in plastic, rubber, wood, or titanium, right? Wo wo wood. Yeah. Not wool. Oh really? Okay. Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment, so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use, because it relates to the overall image of the company, but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this, we cannot use titanium. For for these two we can use titanium, wood, rubber, or plastic. Yeah? Uh okay, the interface options now. So we can have push-buttons, like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons. Ooh. Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh Yeah, yeah, something like that. So, and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing. The scroll plus push. So this is something that has been recently developed by the company, um in the last decade, so not too recent. And L_C_D_s, we can have L_C_D_s. So these two are recent and and this is q quite old. The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one, right? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive, so we can put put in uh whatever we want, but the various integrated circuit options are, we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced. And uh the price goes up as we go down, obviously. Um okay, so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip. Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels. Right? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender. Yeah. Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender, which is did not explained what i what it was, but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know, as soon as you press a button, it it mm uh give gives you feedback, one five or whatever. Yeah, on. Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not, but anyway. So, these are the different options that we have. Okay, so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know, uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that, keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important, yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah. Right. Yeah, it should should do it. Yeah. That's nice one. Mm. Mm. Uh sorry, uh can you go back for a second? Um uh are you sure wha what this means, a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? Uh oh yeah are th Oh okay, the iPod thing, yeah. Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh Alright, right. Okay, okay. So instead of going down you just spin yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. So maybe I should include that here as well, L_C_D_s um plus spinning. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here? Right. So mm uh so it yeah, so probably voice recognition is is kind of important, right? Um and an yeah. Okay, I I have a point about L_C_D_, I dunno if it is the right point to take it up. W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback, right, to the user who's pressing buttons, and the feedback can come through television itself, so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote? Mm. Right. Right. That's true, yeah, that's also Right. Mm-hmm. Mm right. Okay. So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and Right. You you agree? Maarika, yeah? Yeah. So L_C_D_s, yeah, definitely. Go on. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm. Yeah, we we have we have rubber, but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using So if if we use uh latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells, as an energy source that is the constraint, so um we could use titanium, wood or plastic uh or uh Yeah, w energy source. Yeah, tap it on the desk, yeah. Mm. So probably double curved surface is the way to go, yeah,. Or or curved at one end and flat on the top, because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides, then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons, etcetera. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much, does it? It uh Mm. Uh I think uh Right. Right. Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have, I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case. It does not say anything about uh whether technically, you know, this this stuff is available at all. Right, yeah, yeah. Right. Okay. Cool, thanks. Yeah. Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah, so um hand dynamos are definitely out, right? You you got a wind dynamo, yeah. Okay. Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal, but uh it's Yeah. As against a watch, which constantly keeps moving, this this thing will have to be tapped every time, which which might be very frustrating for the user. Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that, yeah, right. Okay, let's keep it option uh keep an option, yeah. Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out, right? It has to be at least curved from one side, yeah. Um okay, we still have all all the options. Wood, do you think wood will be a good idea? Mm. Right. Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break, it's it's much more uh Right. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, okay wood is out. Right. Okay, now for the really interesting stuff, the interface. Right, so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry, but uh it seems to be out of trend, you know, nobody seems to be Mm right. Oh, if if we have L_C_D_ displays, that opens up a whole world, you know, if you have an L_C_D_ display, then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display. Right. Okay. Mm right. So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options. Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine? Or do we have just uh channel plus, channel minus, just to just to scroll? The numbers. Right. Or on the L_C_D_ we can, you know Okay. So mm Alright. Right. Okay, so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um Uh okay. Okay, okay, so the components. Right, so uh what about the the scrolling uh? Mm um I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Uh i it Or or at the corners, edges, just the edges covered by rubber or something like that. Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it. Mm-hmm. Right, right. Right, okay, so so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Um Right. Yeah, and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway, right? So I'll rub that out. And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such, you know, just keep it black, or Mm. Okay. Um okay, if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits. Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering, but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes, so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend. So I'll rub off the other two. Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah. Yeah. So I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one, I mean, a although it does seem uh interesting. But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah. Okay. Uh okay, so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback, right? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that, so Ye yeah, we we don't have too much information about it, um Yeah, okay, so so th this is in as well then, the sample speaker. Right. Flat on the top. Yeah. Okay. I_C_s? Uh integrated circuits. Yeah. Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s, mm. Right. Yep. Mm. Mm-hmm. Cool. Yeah, okay.
@highlight
I sent you the agenda , Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , it was on the in the project documents .
@highlight
so we'll go round each of you in turn we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .
@highlight
so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .
@highlight
I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .
@highlight
Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time .
@highlight
This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here .
@highlight
If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there .
@highlight
So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , so these are the different options that we have .
@highlight
So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?
@highlight
So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells , yeah ?
@highlight
And dynamos .
@highlight
So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this , So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .
@highlight
The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .
@highlight
But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .
@highlight
But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .
@highlight
And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company .
@highlight
Environment friendly .
@highlight
There are different cases that can be provided .
@highlight
They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .
@highlight
Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , Yeah , uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?
@highlight
so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface .
@highlight
we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do the interface options now .
@highlight
Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing .
@highlight
we can have L_C_D_s .
@highlight
so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced .
@highlight
okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip .
@highlight
we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels .
@highlight
Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .
@highlight
besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever .
@highlight
I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .
@highlight
now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , Right , interface concept .
@highlight
Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk .
@highlight
So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again .
@highlight
So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data .
@highlight
So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .
@highlight
Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant .
@highlight
this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .
@highlight
So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn .
@highlight
and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found .
@highlight
so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons .
@highlight
Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well .
@highlight
And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .
@highlight
Our own company has developed a new in user interface we can uh include voice recognition i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .
@highlight
Um s another new development is a scroll button , Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .
@highlight
And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .
@highlight
but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , Um uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ?
@highlight
the scroll button is a different thing .
@highlight
I I have a picture if you just a moment , Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .
@highlight
but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons .
@highlight
It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it .
@highlight
Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time .
@highlight
Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .
@highlight
Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something .
@highlight
Okay , straight to trends , Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future .
@highlight
Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect .
@highlight
So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .
@highlight
Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .
@highlight
So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ?
@highlight
so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ?
@highlight
And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?
@highlight
Depends how fast your television runs , really , I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes so i it actually takes quite a long time .
@highlight
so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that .
@highlight
It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control .
@highlight
So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go Yeah , I think so .
@highlight
because of style and Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .
@highlight
Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture .
@highlight
So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness .
@highlight
'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables .
@highlight
You know ?
@highlight
and possibly even uneven , bit of asymmetry and stuff .
@highlight
But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand .
@highlight
, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy .
@highlight
Something a bit squishy and So it could be like a rubbery and it'd help if you drop it , So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things .
@highlight
so um we could use titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , So probably double curved surface is the way to go , Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think .
@highlight
singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?
@highlight
so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?
@highlight
because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three .
@highlight
It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .
@highlight
Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from .
@highlight
But no , my research didn't tell me anything , Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel .
@highlight
hand dynamos are definitely out , right ?
@highlight
it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up .
@highlight
kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ?
@highlight
You know ?
@highlight
this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .
@highlight
Depends how much how much movement it really needs .
@highlight
Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .
@highlight
Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?
@highlight
I can't imagine a m wooden remote control .
@highlight
and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more I mean it's it's alright for a table , And splinters and stuff and You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?
@highlight
I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?
@highlight
if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display .
@highlight
when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .
@highlight
I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .
@highlight
But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .
@highlight
But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .
@highlight
I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .
@highlight
the case would be rubber and the the buttons , No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside .
@highlight
Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .
@highlight
Or maybe like interchangeable cases .
@highlight
but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .
@highlight
I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .
@highlight
And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .
@highlight
Bananas .
@highlight
but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ?
@highlight
I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .
@highlight
Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , So I'll rub off the other two .
@highlight
So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or a although it does seem uh interesting .
@highlight
Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ?
@highlight
I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .
@highlight
Flat on the top .
@highlight
Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .
@highlight
the advanced chip So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , We need the advanced yeah .
@highlight
and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber .
@highlight
We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours .
@highlight
You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation .
@highlight
And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .
@highlight
In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting .
@highlight
And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

Okay, let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation? Nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. what button? Um. Oh mute. Okay. That certainly does. Mm. Mm. Yeah. 'S great. I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But, that's I don't see why that's not possible. Yeah. They make left-handed scissors, you know. Yes s Mm. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. But um other than that, I mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, I think I think it's great, yeah, great idea. I think it's, well, if the R_R_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, very good, yeah. It's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, all seems to be there. Well done. Um before we move on I need that cable. Thank you. Yeah. Um. One thing I do need to do we need to look at, is the costs. Well, yeah. um Yeah. Uh right. Okay, now I think we'll do this I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power. And the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. Ooh. So the case, we've gone for the double curved. Um and it's made out of rubber. The interface is push-buttons. And button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they? So special colours. Special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff. Yep. Yeah. Um. Are they made out of any special material? No they're not. They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple Okay. Right. So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That is gonna cost uh Yeah. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty. So, this is all very very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay, let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you. Uh. Save it in save it in the uh my documents. Splendid. Okay. So uh, that's done with this with this um doodah, so you're. Gonna do what you were gonna do, your evaluation. F_ eight. I love the smell of that Play-Doh. I cou. I would give it a seven. Oh sorry, one, d yeah. Yeah.. Yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing. So on the technical side of it it Easy to use. I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not. I would give it a I would give it a two, 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but Yeah. Give it a t give it a two. Cost. It's come in under budget. So that's a definite one. Amount of buttons. Contains only the necessary buttons. Yeah. So it's anti-R_S_I_. I don't think it's gonna get lost easily. two. I mean it No, I mean I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but Okay. Alright it's all all systems go. We can't fail.. Well done, Reissa. Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, you know, both individually and as a team. You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two. That's all, you know, gone very very well and and and be you know, has been good communication going on. Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about? Fantastic. I think So I I, you know, and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design. Yeah. You know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, they get Yeah. Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market. Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us. But um No, I think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in. Or six, uh I haven't got message. It gets handed over to another department. What our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically. the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget. When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah, the all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah. Um. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new, it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already. Yeah. Well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that, it's that it's um, hang on, I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off. Um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new. Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_, you can f throw it about, you know. It's fine, it's kid proof. Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that. Yeah. So all in all, I think we've done very well. Well done everybody. Um. Drinks are on the company. In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to. Yeah. That's it. Well, as far as I t as far as I know. Um. No. Anyone wanna play I spy? Yeah, I guess. I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire. Um. It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before. But I'm not the authority to say that it is. Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? Yeah. I thi you know, I'd I'd n yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before. something that t the whiteboard thingy, that's great. Um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean it's i or in such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah.
I used to eat it. Yep. We've got a cool prototype. Double curved. Which is ant anti-R_S_I_. Oh right, yeah. Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. Imagine d are you right handed? Imagine you're doing it with your left hand, I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah. I think it does. Yeah. There you go. Play-Doh is very cheap. Chew proof. Oh ho-ho. Yep. Rubber. Yeah.. Mm-hmm. A one. Well, the kinetic thing, yeah. Well so the um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. Two. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes s yeah. It's yellow. Two. T Mm. Mm. We've, we've done well. Well. You know It is. Y Oh really? Mm yep. Cool. Glad to hear that. Yeah. Yeah.
I've, I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know was edible.. Actually that makes sense, because I remember like, peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We've got some. Yeah, it's pretty exciting. So, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use, yeah, double curved, um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market. So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, the thumb button is the power button. Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, ring finger is volume up, your pinkie is volume down. That's the lock button, has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button. And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available, but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different. So all the, I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them. So you don't you Yeah. It should be. And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote, so you can, you know change that. So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah, that's good thinking, yeah. Yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes. Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that, but I'd yeah,. Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you think it says R_R_? Fashion to electronics. Yeah. Yeah. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue. Plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh. So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah. The costs, was that what you said? But it's edible. That was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so The buttons are rubber. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected. Yeah, have some have some. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Oh, sorry, one. Yeah. That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new. It's ergonomic, but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah. It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere, maybe, yeah, I dunno. Maybe three, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two. Yeah. That was great. Yeah. It is very bright, yeah. It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know. Maybe it will. Uh. You think it could lost Mm. Okay. Yeah, anything, I mean. Okay. It's bigger than the average mobile, I guess. But, yeah, it can get lost. Yeah. Okay, yeah, two is fine. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team. Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams,. Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote. So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something? So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember. But there's not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit? Uh. Hmm. But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing. I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know. We're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse. Mm. Mm. Mm. It make watching T_V_ healthy. Uh. Right, you too. Mm. That's it. I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence. Should we call the day then? Uh, right. Mm-hmm. Your moment to shine. Right, I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step. I guess we should end this, since we're off off topic. So. Shall we Right.
It's Play-Doh. Because kids yeah. But um, it's it's made edible 'cause, yeah. It's made edible 'cause kids eat it, and if it's wasn't edible then Well, normal babies. Oh yeah it is, yeah. Oh yeah. That is cool. What's the big blue thing? Oh cool. And mute. Oh it's so cute. Yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? Yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah, it's not Yeah. Have them in stock. Make 'em more appealing as well.. And all the playing around is uh Yeah, I'm just do you wanna plug in? Okay. Mm. Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them,. Yeah. Yeah. It's better for And special material. Well they're rubber, aren't they? We're under budget. It's already saved, I think. Thank you. Mm. Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to I get to write on the, oops, on the board. Right. Oh. 'S function Okay. Mm. Okay. So, evaluation. We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria. I've got the criterias. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criterias are, and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box. And this is false, this is just like to keep you informed. So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle. So the first criteria. Do you all get what we're doing? Okay, cool. Okay, first criteria, look and feel. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy? So what mark should we give for that? As in it's not. A one a one. So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one. Second criteria, new technology. Have we implemented new technology? As in the new high-tech So it's. So we'll give it a Yeah. I'd say it's about a a twoish? Two. Three. three. So criteria three is is it easy to use? I think it's a one, I think. Two, so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then? Yeah. Yeah, okay. 'Kay, criteria four is costs. 's great. Yeah. Like the amount of buttons, 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one? Um criteria six. R_S_I_ is it good against? Yes. Very good. It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost? Is it easy to get lost? No? But it is smallish. Mm. I think i it would, could be, could get lost. Mm. Yeah. I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean, it's not a one, definitely. Yeah. The mobiles get lost all the time. But then you ring 'em and you find them. So Yeah. So, that's that. So that's the evaluation, so I'd say Yay. It's like like a number one. Um. Number one product. All done, thanks. We fitted all the criterias. Yeah. Yeah, so So that's that one. been cool. In four diff in in four meetings. Funny, all designer meetings could be this quick. They're using our ideas. Yeah. Just start summarising now. You can reply to the same message. See summary, there. If you just reply to that one. Was it was it fifty or five? Depends how much we sell. We finished an hour earlier. Mm. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them. No. Yay. Yep. We haven't got the five minute left thing yet. Mm mm. In project. I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool. Being watched. Um Wow. Mm. Logitech. Yeah. Meeting adjourned.
@highlight
We've got a cool prototype .
@highlight
everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , Double curved .
@highlight
um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .
@highlight
So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button .
@highlight
Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .
@highlight
but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .
@highlight
That certainly does .
@highlight
I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .
@highlight
But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .
@highlight
like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?
@highlight
Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .
@highlight
I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so But we can have both uh Have them in stock .
@highlight
I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .
@highlight
And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .
@highlight
One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .
@highlight
I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .
@highlight
So the case , we've gone for the double curved .
@highlight
and it's made out of rubber .
@highlight
well they're in diff special colours , Special form , We're under budget .
@highlight
That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make .
@highlight
And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .
@highlight
so we evaluate each criteria .
@highlight
And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria .
@highlight
So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?
@highlight
I would give it a seven .
@highlight
As in it's not .
@highlight
Oh sorry , one , d yeah .
@highlight
Second criteria , new technology .
@highlight
Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .
@highlight
w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
@highlight
Maybe three , yeah .
@highlight
So criteria three is is it easy to use ?
@highlight
not if you're left-handed it's not .
@highlight
If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .
@highlight
'Kay , criteria four is costs .
@highlight
It's come in under budget .
@highlight
So that's a definite one .
@highlight
Amount of buttons .
@highlight
Contains only the necessary buttons .
@highlight
R_S_I_ is it good against ?
@highlight
Yes .
@highlight
Very good .
@highlight
does it get lost ?
@highlight
I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .
@highlight
But it is smallish .
@highlight
I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but So that's the evaluation , Number one product .
@highlight
Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , and be you know , has been good communication going on .
@highlight
Now you guys have been a a great team .
@highlight
and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in .
@highlight
I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?
@highlight
I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .
@highlight
Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ?
@highlight
The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
@highlight
I love it .
@highlight
I love it .
@highlight
I think it's cool .
@highlight
Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing .
@highlight
It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .

ES2003a.json,"Okay, well I think we're ready to begin. Right, my name's Adam Duguid, we're here because of real reaction, um, we have in the group Um, yeah, go for it mate. N_ E_ Z_. Ebenezer. And your role is? You're the Marketing Expert, okay. Next we have? T_ R_ I_ K_. And your role in this is? Industrial Designer. And, lastly we have? And you're going to be the User Interface, is it? Designer. Okay. Right. This is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. Um, we already got n through opening, and partially through acquaintance. So, the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, as you probably all know. The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. Course, we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that, but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design. Um, there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway, so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart. This is how today seems to be going to work. We're gonna have the three kay phases, as you've probably already been told, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. Um First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. Second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Of course, you've all got the similar emails, I believe, right. What can I say? Ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Brilliantly done. Thank you. Tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry? Oh, um, you can clip them to your belt. You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well. Yep, the, it's just across there, that's it. Yep. Yeah. It'll follow you if you You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now, I wouldn't worry too much. Should have good range. Excellent, thank you very much. Dave, if you'd like to uh have a dash. Cheers. Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now. Also not quite as feared as your average tiger, but uh cats are one of my favourite animals, they're very independent, they're snotty as hell at the best of times, and uh, what can you say, you got to love those qualities in an animal. Right. I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it, so, on to it. Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit. That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware, and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. Yep. Well, fifty million, and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one, then, awful lot need to be sold. Okay. Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project. So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls. Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? Okay. Okay, yeah, tha that's true, with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah. But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion. Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of Okay, that sounds like a a good strong idea. Um Any takes on this? Okay. Okay. Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before, yeah. Okay, well we're beginning to run out of time now, so, we've got a couple of ideas, we can we'll have to work fast, um, alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, um, how the user interface might work, that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it, you have to have a lot of response back, or at least some kind. Um And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out what the user wants, yes. Um, right. Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage, anything they think that might have been missed so far? I I don't see why not, almost everybody is probably used to a console by now, and all of them incorporate small keypads on them, in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well, so it's probably an interface that most people are used to. Um and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well. Okay. So, small, stylish, and something that's just a little different. Okay. That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily. I would I would have hoped so anyway. Um, right. I'd say we finish this one up, we get started, I'll get in, I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done, and I'll get that out to everybody. Yeah? Okay. Um, as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here, um unless we get told otherwise, and just take the laptops with us.
Oh, Ebenezer Ademesoye. Would you like me to spell that? S Um, N_E_Z_ E_R_. I'm the Marketing Expert. Sure. Whiteboard. 'Kay. S okay. I will make this quick, since we don't have much time. Um. 'Kay, so it's not the best picture in the world. Here we have an elephant. First point, begins with an E_, same like Ebenezer. Also, elephants have a very good memory, much like myself, and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant. So elephants are big, strong and gentle, and they have great memories, and they begin with the letter E_, just like Ebenezer. Thank you. Oh. Oh oh I think you ga The little The the Oh that's good, we can clip them on. Okay. Yeah, there was this microphone as well that you Just um somewhere I think so. Yeah. There you go. Oh, that was profiting, that was an amount, so that's the amount made, okay. Yeah. Oh. 'Kay Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, um keypad, for playing games. So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television. They they've recently brought out this new remote control, for people to set their favourite channels, or um to record things. Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and slide another bar to say what time it ends, you know that's Yeah, it's it's taken out the Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control. I think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot. Uh, you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television, so you need buttons to change the television angle, the camera angles and stuff like that. Yeah. What the user wants uh. Okay. Oh. Okay,. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. So..
Tarik Rahman. T_A_R_I_K_. Industrial Designer.. Do we take them off? Oh right, okay. Ah-ha. Now where do I put the Is this supposed to be clipped as well? Uh, destroying your elephant here. Uh, here we have a tiger. Uh I've always loved tigers. They're just they're big, they're biggest cats, uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat, just 'cause it was looks the best, the stripes, orange. My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid. And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild. So uh that's why I like them. Didn't say an anything about me really but Mm. 'Kay. Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff, do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? Like uh control pads, you know of games, but or is that a bit ridiculous? Yeah..
Uh, Dave Cochrane. User Interface Defin Designer, yes. Um Um, the monkey, um. The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey. Um, monkeys have attitude. Which I think is a good thing. And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting. Um, so I like monkeys. And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most. Well, one thing I'm aware of is, th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs, you can programme in macros, and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one, five in one, whatevers, but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control, to a much greater extent, and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel, get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound, for instance. Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket. Absolutely prohibitive, yeah. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion. Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros. For instance, um let's say oh oh um, or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. But of course, uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall,. A curve, mm-hmm. Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form, uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway.

that was profiting , Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?
@highlight
one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design .
@highlight
And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .
@highlight
with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our Absolutely prohibitive , But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .
@highlight
I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros .
@highlight
Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , I've seen the bar-code design before , Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games .
@highlight
I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .
@highlight
Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ?
@highlight
Like uh control pads , you know of games , and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .
@highlight
Mm-hmm .
@highlight
The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , um , how the user interface might work , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand .
@highlight
But of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , .
@highlight
small , stylish , and something that's just a little different .
@highlight
Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

ES2002d.json,"No. Ninja Homer, made in Japan. And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions? So the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use. Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial? Okay 'cause The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing. If you're using an advanced function right, like um c brightness, contrast, whatever, it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns, it's a very simple L_C_D_ like, whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast. It might even be one, a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the the symbols of the various functions. That's a number pad. Um they're al along this Yeah. You have this space here, and then you have this thing on the side as well, or at the bottom. 'Cause slogans are usually quite small, right, they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about say a button's about this size, right, so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan, say even for that. Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button, so one two three four centimetres. Plus maybe half o five six seven eight, about yeah nine total. Nine, ten. Yep. Excuse me. Sure. Oh we've discussed how h high it is, but how wide is it? No as in the height, but what about the width? Do we need five? I don't think five is be about th three and a half. Yeah, yeah. Okay things like um brightness, contrast, um maybe tuning the channels. Um. What else? Um the various inputs. Are you having a V_C_R_, are you having you know which input do you have? Um. Yep, colour, sharpness. Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them. Audio, we have like your basic y your base, your mid-range, your high range. Um. Yep, left-right balance, um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes, like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes, and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting. Yeah. The battery. No. Um. We need an Yep. Yeah advanced chip. We need an advanced chip I think, yep. Let me just confirm that. Yes I think so. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Plastic. I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber. Um. Yep. For the case itself, one colour. It's one special colour. 'Cause the case unit itself, the rest of our components go on top of it. Yes. One and the L_C_ display. How many We've got push buttons as well. Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one. Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons, so maybe four again. 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons. So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less. No. Yep. Yep. How much would that save us? That will only save you one. The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together, um because when you do something on the T_V_, the T_V_ responds and reacts as well, so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond, which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep. And the advanced chip goes away as well. Regular chip. Yep. So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there. Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah, so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons, four, eight, twelve. It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone, underneath there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. We just report that it has to be over budget, or the colours, you could take away s colours for th for the buttons. Normal coloured buttons. No that's not the button we're talking about. That's the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off uh? Hey it's back to the original. Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons, so that might be some some way of cutting the cost. Yeah. What do you mean by profile? No. We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_. So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add, and you might want to add in the report, length, width, and height. Yeah. Yeah. Two. This is about this is about two. Slightly more than two, so Okay. I think that's something that's very hard to catch, so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something. The the look and the colour is something which is cool, but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change, rather than rather than positioning, 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad. Maybe we should do the design evaluation first. I don't think you need the power, so No, that's okay that's okay. No, the power cord itself. Yeah, so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers. You killed a monster. I rate that pretty highly. Yep I'm fine with that. It's one to seven, right? Wait, what's the scale, one to seven, right? Okay, it's upside-down. Say it's more medium, but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing. Yep. Lemon. Okay, the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour, except for the b the the red button, they because for want of a Yeah, the the yellow is more representative of the colour, but the button itself, the blue can be anything else. Yep, that's fine. Yeah, company logo. I think it'll be cost prohibitive, yeah. Yep. The cameras did. Yep. It keeps getting too big. 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing, so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well. Just in case you're wondering, why is he still playing with the Play-Doh? Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego. You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage, it can only go so big and not hit the side. The constraints do come in very fast. Yeah. I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings, so time is also a very s um strong factor, and structure. Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed, um to be evaluated, and to be reviewed, and to get feedback and come back. And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that, I think that's a very big thing, and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses, right, and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate. I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment, rather than the equipment is helping me, and you know. Not not so much an atmosphere, the atmosphere is very relaxed, but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts Excuse me. I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured. I think structure is probably what you're saying that, each individual is structured to one particular task, and one parti rather than controlling. I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a, like a consensus right, we go around and we think about it, but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way. It doesn't tell you, you know, some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know, not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate, but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a, you know, a messenger will go. Yeah. Okay. I think the tools that they were given, the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration, I think that's the word. They don't support the team working together, you know, they're still very individual tools. We had Play-Doh fun. No, not really. I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard, and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think. It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint, or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place, you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings. 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that. And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints, I don't think, you know, we needed to actually it could have, we could have gone through it verbally, especially my slides, I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them. Yep clunky. Agreed. Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well, 'cause you're half way through a thought, and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump. But I think the pen is v is very intuitive, everybody knows how to use it, we don't have to worry. So I think the pen's good. It's about the best thing. Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something, you know, it's useful but I think too many computers are just distracting. Um Yep. And we have Ninja Homer. Ninja Homer. See it looks like Homer Simpson but it's electronic so it's made in Japan. Yeah it's just a logo. Ninja Homer. The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it. You can wear Homer, you can throw Homer when you're frustrated, doh. It's clunky. Oh, I did learn something new, Play-Doh is useful. No it is it is. It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing, in being creative. 'Cause like you say, it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for. Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else. You might wanna write that down. It's just, I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh, and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool. No, all Play-Doh is edible. It's just wheat, it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh It's helpful to the creative process. Um it engages all your senses not just your sight, but your sense of feel your sense of touch. And it helps you to understand dimension as well. I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up, whereas on a piece of paper, on a computer, on a board, um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still, it requires a lot of yeah tangible, that's a nice word. It becomes tangible. Nope. I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate. Can we turn off the microphones?
Okay we all all set? Right. Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting. Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design, the user interface design, and we're gonna evaluate the product. And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control, like absolute final decision, um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report. So um just from from last time to recap, we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display, no need for talk-back, it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing, um hopefully a jog-dial, and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well. Anything I've missed? Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be Mm-hmm. Okay cool. Oh right okay. Cool. Where are we gonna have the slogan? Okay cool. Okay. Okay. So if this isn't to scale, what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here? Mm-hmm. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So we're talking about ten centimetres. That would be good. So ten centimetres in height. Okay um. Yeah. That's great and it's very bright as well. So um okay. Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay so that's like an okay button, right. Okay. Oh oh like depth of the actual thing. Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay. So you can power on and off, what else can you do? Okay. Okay jog-dial for volume. And what else do you do with the jog-dial? Contrast, brightness, yeah, and anything else? Well of the designers what are they? Uh-huh. Okay channel tuning. That's a good one. Okay auxiliary inputs. Sharpness. Okay what about uh sound settings? Uh d can you change any of those at all? Okay. Okay, is there anything else at all it can do? That 'cause that's that's fine. Just need to know so I can write it down. Okay um right I g I guess that's it, so we can now um We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing, and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all. So um for this first part here power-wise, have we got battery? Do we have kinetic as well? No. Okay, just battery. And that's because of cost restraints is it? Okay um what about the electronics here? Advanced chip. Okay um the case, what does it mean by single and double, do you know? So we want double-curved? Okay. Um. Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay, um and we wanted special colours didn't we? So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there? Just one colour, okay. Okay so interface-wise, is it this third option we have, the two of them there? Okay and then buttons, we have what, two colours? Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Four. So w why are we arriving at the number four? Where does the number four come from? Okay right, so we're writing down four. Okay. How about these? Are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic? Okay. So we're w w quite far over. Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go. Um we're at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro, so let me see, what are we I mean oh yes sorry, four point three. My maths is all out. Yeah. How much would that save us? One. Okay so So w what's our reviewed suggestion? Um take away the L_C_ display? To be replaced with a regular chip. Okay. And so we've got point three to get rid of. Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now? Twelve buttons. Yeah. Do you think? Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons, how can it be something in between? Mm. Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere. Mm. No can do. Well do you want colour differentiation here? Oh yeah sorry yeah then. Right so Ah. That's it. Okay, ach that's a shame. Um right, so take away that completely? Ah. And now we're under budget. So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted. Um Doesn't say so. Yeah that's a good idea. Just one? Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay. Well well there we go. So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now. So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore, and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing, which I think is fair enough, and so this is gonna be one big thing here. Um. Right okay. So just to well to be thorough then, width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something? Okay and then so height-wise How how tall do you envisage it being? About that big? About two centimetres, okay. Okay. Ach, that is Yeah. Okay we'll s we'll say two point five. Okay um so we have it within cost anyway. Um so yeah project evaluation is this point. Um. Right uh. Okay so can we close that? This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be. Someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine. Okay. Right um. So at this point we uh, let me see, discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points, with the room for creativity in the project, and leadership and teamwork, and the stuff we had around us I guess. Um, let me see uh Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was Yeah, yeah go for that first. I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that, but y you go for it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Oh there it is. Mm 'kay. Okay. Well yeah, I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good. I dunno like a six or something. What does anybody else think? Mm. Mm. Okay. I would say five or six. David? Okay. Oh yes sorry then, then I would say two or three. Yeah. Well it has the wee jog-dial but Mm. I'd go with three or four, maybe three. Yeah about three, okay. Well that's kind of But the yellow, I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour, couldn't it? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well yeah, I mean it's really basic looking isn't it? I mean I'd give that nearly a one. Five? That's really low. Well Yeah I suppose mm 'kay. Yep. Gonna have that on the side, aren't we, like there or something? Out of forty nine, I guess. 'S pretty good. Uh yeah. Twice that, about thirty one. So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine, seventy percent yeah. It's pretty good. Okay. Nobody saw it, honestly. Is that you all have all finished, or Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Okay, great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I? I don't know what your instructions have been. Okay, uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes, because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great. Cool. Um right, uh well next up then, because we've done finance, is the project evaluation. Oh right, okay. Right, okay. Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points, my four points, sorry, forgotten that. You got a different uh Oh yeah, they're good aren't they, yeah. Right okay, um yeah here we are. Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically. Um do you wanna start Andrew? I don't know, just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing? But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. I think it means like you know Yeah. Room. Oh yeah. Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay uh do you know what, actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it, I think. Yeah. So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or Yeah, but actual environment? Okay. Okay. Very good. Um what about leadership? I don't know if that means like, if I did a good job or something. I don't really know. From like your personal coach person and stuff like that, do you think maybe? Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, okay. So you think maybe a little too controlling or Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, uh what about teamwork? Yeah. Okay. Mm. Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you? Oh that's alright. I was wondering if that got there okay. Okay, um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue, saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting, you know just like quick questions, quick thoughts, whatever, it probably would be bit easier. Oh right, okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right, uh anything else to say on teamwork at all? Okay, um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard, the digital pens, the projector, stuff like that? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful, anything was pretty un f unsupportive? Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And point at? Yeah. Yeah. Ah. So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Okay uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What about the digital pens, did you find them easy enough to use? Yeah. Clunky, okay. Um Yeah. I know, I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff, didn't click note on one, then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page, but then did click note, and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something, but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting? Okay. I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually, like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that, um I don't know about anybody else. Um what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found. Um I don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all? Mm. Yeah if we just had uh Mm-hmm. Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do, and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design, I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah. I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room, and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down, just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings, but There you go. Um so in closing, I haven't got my five minutes to go. Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go. Wonderful. Okay um are the costs within the budget, yes they are. And is the project evaluated, yes it is. So now celebrate. Well apparently now I write the final report. What are you guys doing now? You dunno? That is lovely. So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything? Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer, right okay. I think it's quite nice. Oh no, that's cool, it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber, I think that would have been nice. Ah well, maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money. Play-Doh s Really? Yeah. Did they? Okay. Play-Doh. Yeah, it smells funny doesn't it. Um Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be, yeah. Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Tangible. Okay uh Mm. I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss. That that's about it really. Just sit still I guess for a little while. Um Well I dunno. Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now. Yeah, yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so.
Uh-oh. This is it? Um, there are a few changes we've made. Um, well look at the expense sheet, and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside, so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen, um just a a very very basic one, very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button. Uh, apart from that, it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time. You know, just like right inside there. Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand. Well I'm We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button. Um But um this button um, because it's red it's sort of very prominent, we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal. Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial. I don't know. Didn't put five centimetres. Um. Something by there. Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons. Um, were gonna have the volume control here, but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume. Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast, colour and Um yeah. Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions, um we didn't actually go through and specify the Uh what can a T_V_ do? Um. the the balance hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing. Um we have um got some push buttons as well. 'Kay. So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber. I'm not sure if that counts but You can see we're we're all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved, just fill in those bits. That is one. That's fair enough, yeah. That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons. I think there's just one button so handy. Yeah. You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat. Yeah it works, yeah. See, about that thick. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. I'm seeing five then. One's high-ish isn't it? Ah, okay so yeah, two or three. Eight three. Yeah. Yeah one. Yeah I think it's about five. Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be I think I'd probably increase the cost. We've only got like what, ten cents left so Yeah. My leg. Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. Uh, reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, that would've been a lot easier. Not just yet. Yeah. Oh they're a bit clunky. Good point. Yeah. Is this for the project or Oh yeah. Do we know what the other ones are? Oh wow. Hey yeah, I said Ninja Homer. Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells. I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds. Yeah it's not very tangible.
Mm 'kay. Where are they? Ah, right. Great. Right. Okay. Right. Right, 'kay. Okay. Mm-hmm, and what is this here? Okay so the number pad is 'Kay, great. Mm. Yep. Looks good. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. About nine in total. That sounds good. Yeah. Yep. That'd be good, in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually, so that would be that sounds like a really good size, if you see it there. Mm. Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours. Is these are these the colours that of production, or is this just what we had available? Right. Mm-hmm. How high is it? Yeah. Okay. Sure. Three and a half. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, probably colour or sharpness. Mm-hmm. Audio. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm. Or even clear. Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if We only have very sparse Two point three? Four point three no? And then where is the Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah we could just go with um Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. How about with embossing the logo, isn't that going to cost us some money? Yeah. That's a freebie. Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible? Sort of flat as possible. Yeah. Yeah that's what I was thinking, to Sure, okay. Yeah alright yeah fair enough. Okay, just thought I'd ask. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Two's not very high at all though. Maybe a bit higher? Yeah. Maybe closer to three even or two and a half. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into, but um just in in that we want this to be stylish, should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid, because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid, and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah. Sure, okay. Yeah, alright. Okay, sure. What about button shape? Square buttons? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Do you want me to d um Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last? Or Evaluation. Okay. Sure. Um, alright so the way this works, I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint, I'll try and do it as quick as possible. Um, this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay. What's that? I don't need the PowerPoint? Oh course, yeah that's true. Let me get that. A bit more. Okay, so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning, and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan, and uh so we can review that. Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going, does it? Yeah, okay great. Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board, so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it. Okay, so um So to sort of b bring together two things, sort of design goals and also the market research that we had, uh when we rate this, one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low, okay. So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this, so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement. Okay? So the first one uh, stylish look and feel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour, and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit. But What do you guys think? Okay. Okay let's go with five then. Fi oh uh just actually the opposite. The So it meant three, okay. Yeah, one is high. 'Kay Let's go with two point five then. Okay, um control high tech innovation. We had to remove Yeah, so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted, but jog-dial 's good. Okay, three? Okay, um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour, design. I shouldn't have said colour, but just Sorta. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah, could be. Yeah. Okay. Okay so we'll go two. Yeah? Okay, and um design is simple to use, simple in features. F f yeah f fairly basic, you guys think? Yeah, one? Okay. Um, soft and spongy, have we achieved that? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price. Five? That's Um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it? Was that an option? It would cost more than plastic. Okay, logo, we've got it in there, haven't we? Huh. And um it's within budget, yep. It is, isn't it? Okay, so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here? Yeah, out of forty nine with with zero being the highest. We are at uh two, seven, eight, ten, fifteen point five. So it's pretty good. Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal. Right? I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one, and then invert that, it's Oh right, about seventy, yeah seventy percent. Okay, good. That was just a little formality for us to go through. Yep, oh hundred pound pen. Sorry alright. No. Hmm. Yeah that's that's me. I did have one other um one other frame I thought, I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information, I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design, revisiting our original goals. It's not something I need to p push through, but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions, um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the, I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant, I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones, lime green, lemon. It's just discussion. I mean obviously we can just abandon this, it's fine. I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do. Um, yep so there. That's all. Um, I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet. Yeah. I will, yeah. Huh. Yep. I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that. It's really quick. To use. Sure, um so what is it you're asking of me now? Or sort of our work on setting this up. Yeah. Well, is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then. The the room uh is fairly institutional, but um the main thing is, I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion, you know, as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity, whereas in reality as we've gone through this, it's not really the centre point of creativity, it's more just a d debating Yeah, yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there, the room, it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave, and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then, you know. Oh, oh right right, oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard, digital pens, the room. No, of course, yeah. Sorry. Huh. Yeah. Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this, but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends, say fruit and vegetable colour scheme, but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours. So what do we do. We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. New creativity. Yep. Right. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction, encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think, just sort of acting as team leader. Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good. I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation, but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know, innovative thought with. In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within. And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member, so But it's not bad leadership, it's just sort of s fairly strong, you know. It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism, as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah, oh yeah, without without a doubt. Yeah maybe not co confining. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah. Um did, you wanna comment Craig? Yeah. Yeah. Fully agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, got the email. Yeah. Yeah, in it Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, exactly. Yeah, I mean if you Yeah, I mean sort of taking upon that idea, w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided, and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together, maybe that was a bit different, but um yeah, but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay, first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept, and we sit here together and do it, well that's what teamwork is. To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other, it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork. Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done. I'm not dissatisfied with it. Mm-hmm. I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time, but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been, maybe just in the way that we we use it, in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text. Um, and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that. I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product, but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks, we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds. It wasn't until we had this here, you know, like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like, now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book. But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare, whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush, for example, or whatever, I would've actually used it, um 'ca you know, just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, not quite. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And o on the topic of the technology, it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files. It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer. If there had been a fifth, that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other. So, that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea, well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Great. So it So now we I I don't know. Hmm. What did you call it? Huh, huh. Logo. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Fashion technology or something. Hmm, hmm, hmm. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Huh. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's true, yeah. Hmm. And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they? Wow, hmm. Huh. Yep. Taste. Yeah. Mm-hmm, yep. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do we retreat to our, to continue our r reporting or what i
@highlight
Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting .
@highlight
Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .
@highlight
And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
@highlight
we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .
@highlight
Um , there are a few changes we've made .
@highlight
Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
@highlight
the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .
@highlight
Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?
@highlight
The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .
@highlight
If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .
@highlight
That's a number pad .
@highlight
Where are we gonna have the slogan ?
@highlight
just like right inside there .
@highlight
Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .
@highlight
So we're talking about ten centimetres .
@highlight
We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .
@highlight
uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .
@highlight
this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .
@highlight
Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?
@highlight
be about th three and a half .
@highlight
what else can you do ?
@highlight
Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .
@highlight
but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .
@highlight
And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?
@highlight
Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .
@highlight
Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .
@highlight
left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all .
@highlight
for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?
@highlight
Do we have kinetic as well ?
@highlight
No .
@highlight
And that's because of cost restraints is it ?
@highlight
Yep .
@highlight
We need an advanced chip I think , yep .
@highlight
So we want double-curved ?
@highlight
I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .
@highlight
um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?
@highlight
For the case itself , one colour .
@highlight
It's one special colour .
@highlight
We've got push buttons as well .
@highlight
So we're w w quite far over .
@highlight
Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .
@highlight
something's gonna have to go .
@highlight
Um we're at sixteen point eight and The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .
@highlight
or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .
@highlight
No can do .
@highlight
Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , And now we're under budget .
@highlight
sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .
@highlight
width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?
@highlight
How how tall do you envisage it being ?
@highlight
About two centimetres , okay .
@highlight
Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .
@highlight
Okay we'll s we'll say two point five .
@highlight
but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , I think that's something that's very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .
@highlight
What about button shape ?
@highlight
Square buttons ?
@highlight
Yeah Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .
@highlight
discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .
@highlight
I rate that pretty highly .
@highlight
Okay let's go with five then .
@highlight
Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .
@highlight
Let's go with two point five then .
@highlight
high tech innovation .
@highlight
so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial Yeah about three , okay .
@highlight
Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .
@highlight
the the yellow is more representative of the colour , Okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , so we'll go two .
@highlight
and um design is simple to use , simple in features .
@highlight
I mean I'd give that nearly a one .
@highlight
Um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?
@highlight
We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .
@highlight
Yeah I think it's about five .
@highlight
logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?
@highlight
And um it's within budget , yep .
@highlight
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .
@highlight
We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .
@highlight
So it's pretty good .
@highlight
I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .
@highlight
It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .
@highlight
Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?
@highlight
Yeah , yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .
@highlight
But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .
@highlight
answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual The constraints do come in very fast .
@highlight
it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .
@highlight
I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .
@highlight
and and the time the time given also restricts In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within .
@highlight
And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .
@highlight
I think the interactions are very structured .
@highlight
So you think maybe a little too controlling or Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .
@highlight
I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .
@highlight
uh what about teamwork ?
@highlight
If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .
@highlight
I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .
@highlight
I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .

@highlight
I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .
@highlight
And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?
@highlight
Oh they're a bit clunky .
@highlight
Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , So I think the pen's good .
@highlight
And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .
@highlight
We only actually needed one computer .
@highlight
And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .
@highlight
well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .
@highlight
I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c And we have Ninja Homer .
@highlight
Well apparently now I write the final report .
@highlight
I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .
@highlight
It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .
@highlight
Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .
@highlight
It becomes tangible .","```

IS1009c.json,"Hi. Mm-hmm. Interface designer. Yes. Yes. Okay, I can start first. Okay. Now my slide, please. Three. Participant three. Yes. Okay. Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers. Next, please. Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel, like you can have the numbers one, two, three, four, up to nine. Pardon me? Yes, nine numbers. And then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa. Then it should have a next button, and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one. Next slide, please. Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume. Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen. Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. There should be a mute button. Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call, and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_, but he he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit. So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers, you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television, for example, if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, uh th now the the uh yeah, the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel. So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities. So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have. So this is one one of the interface which can be created. A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features. Then, please, next slide. Then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons. So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. Even a kid can use that. So can you go on t t uh to the next slide. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. And this has multi-purpose use, it can be used for T_V_, it can be used for cable-satellite, it can be used for V_C_R_, D_V_D_s and audio. And this has in-built voice recogniser. Can you go on to the next slide? Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use. Uh this is user-friendly, it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it. And this comes with different colours, different shapes. And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small, compact, attractive child interface. Next slide, please. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. this. So this is No this is a very big, you cannot misplace it anywhere. So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose. This i this is one such interface which can be created. And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function. Thank you, that's Mm yes. Okay. Okay. We can. It works. Mm yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Transmit. Okay. Okay. Push-buttons. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Uh yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. This could be uh one feature which could be sellable. Mm-hmm. No, it's it's, uh yeah, it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th For example, you have a T_V_ system, I'm the user and my family members are the user, I will already record uh a question like, uh good morning, like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television. So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on. It will recognise my voice and will switch on. Battery. Yes. Yes. And compact. Trendy design and compact. Yes. Push-buttons. And Supplements like different types of features buttons, like can have a f mute button or a swapping button. Recogniser. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Hi. Yeah, I think that pretty much is it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You don't know me. I could lose that in a minute. Well, um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there. Um what uh I'm No suggestion's bad. But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. I don't think that we can get uh The T-shape is good, the child one is good, the too big to misplace, I think it's just funny. Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter. It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy. Yeah mm. Mm-hmm. Have to come back to that later. Okay. No, I think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good point. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Okay. Hmm, that's interesting. Uh yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button? Mm-hmm. Um. We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost. Okay. Okay. Go right to my first my next slide. Um alright, my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers. I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing. And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that, I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have, and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it. And I would encourage you all to do the same. Um and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. Um people like something that really fits in their hand. Simple is beautiful. They don't want to have to squint at small print um, they want buttons whose functions are obvious, and they want um as few buttons as possible, and they don't care for the mode thing. They want each button to do something. And eye-catching is important. It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing. Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um and our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, are we got to get to the market before the competition. Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others, so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item. And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign. If we try to tell people it has too many great features, um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things, I think, that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them. So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item. Mm-hmm. You wanna try to come back to yours, and limit yours a bit? Okay. So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned? Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature. That that be really good, yeah, I agree with that. Distance problem? Uh. I think I think battery, and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing. Yep. Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. Mm-hmm. Well, I think that Yeah, or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement. Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement. Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is. Okay. Wherever they're hiding?
Hi. Yeah, good. Hmm. Yeah. Going to the nex next. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe. Participant two. Uh the next one, sorry. It's it was the old one. Components. Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design. Uh, can you go on to the next slide, please. I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction. Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery, etcetera, etcetera, it's like Uh it can be a plastic one, hard plastic, so that it can be strong, even if you just uh uh, you know, if you if it falls down, then it doesn't break. So it should be strong. And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that. And it should be recyclable. Uh and uh, yeah, and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components. And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit. Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one. And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures. Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside, it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures. And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility. And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery, capacitor. Can you go on to the next slide, please? Uh a diode, a transistor, a resonator, these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller. A battery uh, I would like to suggest one thing uh if we uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much. It it it's not a high voltage battery. Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one, then uh people can use it for a long time, so in that way we can cut cut the cost, but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one. And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller. Can you go to the next slide, please. And how it works, how the remote controller works. When you press a button Thank you. Uh when you press a button, when you do that, you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button, and it will send some signals through the wires, and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed. Suppose you have pressed channel one button, number one you have pressed, then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed. It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button. Every button, every individual button, has its own morse code. Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one, then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button, and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. Like you have got a signal by pressing a button. That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit. Now, that signal, that morse code, has to be amplified by the transistor. That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller. It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits. The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately, that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal, then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do. Then it will do the appropriate action. So uh this is how the remote controller works. Can you go to the next slide, please. Yeah, I have few pictures. When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller. And to the next slide, please. And where we had a a few buttons and all. And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components, like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins, and also a capac uh a capacitor, three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah, and di and a diode transistor. The electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an Yeah, di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um. Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors, and uh just beside that you can see a transistor, and a uh uh cylinder shape, uh that one is a capacitor. Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry, ther there is a diode. Can you go go on to the next slide. So uh this is the circuit board. The green one is a circuit board. Actually, uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper, because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires, it's it's better to go for printing, because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing, nothing like uh, you know, you don't need to use wires and all. It's not exactly wires we are using. It's just printing something on a board. Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits. So th that green uh thing is a circuit board, and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons, like when you press a button, the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the, yeah, um integrated circuit. Can you go to the next slide, please. Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons. Uh can you see the black uh, round marks? They they are the circuits. Next, please. And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls. Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip. Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious uh hard dynamo, um a kinetic provision of energy, more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy. So that also we can have in a battery, uh or we can use solar sells. Uh. Yeah. Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases. Uh usually, the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller. Um. Yeah. Yeah, maybe d uh I have just one more slide, I think. Um. Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, but titanium we can't use. Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print, um also infra it includes the infrared se sender. Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker. An Yeah, that's it. It's all for me now, thank you. No, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different, like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before, I think. Now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all. So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons. Yeah uh yeah, push-buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but w Yeah. Yeah, but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems, issues. Yeah, it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice, like maybe different people will be having different voices, so it like it's uh everything so i So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also strong. Trendy, yeah. Uh. Um like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface. Push-buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you.
Okay. Hello everyone. Um how uh how we doing? Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less. Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working, meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given. Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use. Um it's also an item that people lose a lot. So we should address that. And, of course, it should be something s s that is very simple to use. In addition to that to make it sell, of course, uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive, or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because, in particular with smaller items, that's a very important fact, 'cause um if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work. Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve. And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan. Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip. Therefore, messages uh will be controlled in the same manner. There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep. If too many buttons are pressed, mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch. Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes. So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infra infra-red bulbs, battery, chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item. Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it, of course, should have an on-off button, and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock. Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable. It should be compact. Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped. And maybe have an anar alarm-clock. And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature. Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves. Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature. And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote. Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Okay. Okay, then we I'm looking for three presentations. And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh, I don't I don't think so, so whoever w wants Yeah, okay. Okay, your slides. Okay. Oh, come on, close already. And that's number two, right? Three. Okay. Nine what? Nine channel uh switches? Nine channel switches? Is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you very much. Uh any comments on uh her presentation? Yeah, I I th I think No, I think the these are her presentations, but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Ho who wants to go next um? Mm-hmm. Okay, and you Uh okay. Oops. The components design. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go away. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. And you have more pictures. Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting. Okay, well thank you. Any particular comments by anybody? We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision, and the marketing expert has to present her her thing. Uh okay. Okay. Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone. And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote. And uh so what do we think on the concept of the remote? Y Okay. Mm-hmm. I think that's Mm-hmm. Well, you you teach You have to teach uh Okay, before we get too far off here um, the components of the concept is the energy. What kind of energy do we foresee? Battery. Battery. Okay then chip on print. Okay. And the case. And I think we all agree on the case, we wanna have something uh maybe bright, colourful. Mm-hmm. Trendy design, compact and strong. User interface concept, uh interface type, supplements. That will be your area I think, right, Jana. Put uh k I guess uh for yeah. And Not sure what they mean by supplements. Oh, like Oh. A what? Right, right, right, mm-hmm. Right. Okay. Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes, and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have the look and feel design, and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design, and the marketing expert with the product evaluation. In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here. You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches. Um if you have any questions, you know, you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach, I suppose. Um so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes, according to our timetable here. Thank you very much.

Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ?
@highlight
Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like Okay .
@highlight
Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television .

@highlight
uh or we can use solar sells .

@highlight
That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing .
@highlight
Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong .
@highlight
Trendy design , compact and strong .
@highlight
Not sure what they mean by supplements .

ES2002c.json,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. It kinda does make sense, doesn't it, because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background. Everything I have is kinda background. Mm-hmm. Uh that sounds. Sure. Okay. Sure. Yeah, cool. Why don't I get that? Hmm. Okay. Okay. Um alright so c is it function F_ eight? Hmm. Come on. I think it's working. Okay great s so let me just start this. Okay great. So um uh s move on. Uh-huh oh where'd it all go? It's not good. Okay lemme just see where I can find it. This looks more like it. I think I just opened up the template. Sorry about that. Okay alright so let's have a look here. Okay so this was the method that um I've taken. Uh basically what I wanna do here, before we get into it uh too far, is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful. And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information, and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision. Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us, and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far, and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project. Does that make sense, tha that sort of strategy? I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do, so that's why I suggested we get in this. Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general, um consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control, a fancy look and feel, okay, and not, it specified, not a functional look or or feel, uh b f f fancy. Um however, this is where we kinda have to be very, I think, creative about it. Number two was that it be innovative. Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it. Uh and third priority uh for ease of use, so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be, um quite user friendly while still having technology. So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing, is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel, and not so much to the functionality of it. For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something, you know what I mean, like, or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use. So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this. Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style, okay, which as we've agreed is a priority. Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables, okay, especially in clothes and furniture. And when I first saw that I thought hmm, well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it, or we get right into it, or we completely steer away from it, do you know what I mean? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend, but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics. Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor, partly something like a computer, um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something, I think that would be pushing it. And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of, you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle, which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case. So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode, so if we try and really capitalise on that, I think that'll be in our favour. Um So these this is the summary of everything. Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to. Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge, uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout. That was like the number three thing. And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway, softness in materials, shape, and function, and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion, Mac iPods, something which is, I'd have to say very high-tech, ten gigabytes, whatever, but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons. You know what a Mac iPod is? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy, so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have. Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas, and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things, that we think about shape, materials, and themes or series that go throughout. Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all, that we agree on, uh sorta like a marketing identity. Um Does that make sense? Yeah. So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon, lime, I dunno, green colours, pe whatever, it's just an idea, 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture, shape, colours, things like that. Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that, you know something which is, like you see a lot in in other areas. Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and So anyway it's just just an idea. I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it. Like you know just within the simple sense, when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up, q usually the buttons light up. How can we build on that? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so. Anyway those are that's all I have, but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into Yep. Did you press F_ eight? Yeah. Okay, do we have a corporate colour scheme? I didn't know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Great. Lots of good information there. It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table, huh? Just um It takes a second, doesn't it? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. They're standard, aren't they? Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It can't be curved. Okay. Uh question on can I ask a question? Okay. Can we uh power a light in this? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light? Okay. So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery. Well I mean I'm thinking it might be That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power, and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is, can the battery power it? Illuminate the buttons. Yeah it glows. Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this, and that's what everybody does. Oh where's the volume button in the dark, and uh y you just touch it, or you just pick it up, and it lights up or something. Like a phone, yeah yeah. Whereas with phones, people charge them once a week. We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days. But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller? Right. Sure. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? Yeah. Okay. Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts, and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel. So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour, you said company colour yellow. I mean if we think of something, like I was saying also lime and lemon you know, what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series. We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things. Yeah. Yeah. No no no not at all. It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve, so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with. Do you know what I mean? Right, sure. Yeah. Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it. Okay. Okay. Yep. Mm. What would it achieve? Well L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about. And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings. So as you scroll through, 'cause we said we might have a jog dial, so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is. Right, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm not real Mm-hmm. No. Mm mm. Well i I was just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Um I've had kinetic things before, and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it, and watches yeah Sure, okay, right, okay. Support for it. I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time, and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery. I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time, and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time. Like remote control is similar, you're away on vacation, I dunno whatever, you something, and it just starts to get worn down. So we should think about Yeah. Yep. And this size here, I'd suggest this be small, like quite small. Um just a a lot of the um I mean one of the things running through my mind right now, I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made, um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech, rubber buttons plastic frame, it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there. Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals? Like Okay so so backlighting, that would be good. Yeah clear, that'd be Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah that'd be really good. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah they they emanate a light through it. 'Kay. Yeah, mm-hmm. Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity, and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled, 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do. Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice just sort of round, somewhere on it where you just roll it? Or Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well why don't we do it like a mouse then? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Mm. Yeah. But that's not a bad thing is it? Because when you think about it, the alternative is to go push the button. Jog dials are much easier than that. You just roll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here, I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea, imagine that, I dunno, that it's within the shape of the hand, it's quite small I dunno. Yeah. It's small, and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side, and that yeah well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now? Yeah. And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here, in with the It would get bumped, it's doesn't really fit with your hand. Yeah. Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here. A jog di Yeah. It's kind of yeah Yeah. Huh. Um Yeah I think the jog dial, you know it just after you drew that, what if it was flat and you just spun it, that'd be great. Yeah. Yep. Sure, yeah, yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber, didn't we, and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons, 'cause that'd just be so standard. Something a bit more flush, yeah, or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well, so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured, so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand. They feel kind of like um, you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not, they're actually just plastic that's textured, kind of a little bit like Okay. Okay.
Is it working? And so think of this concept. Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again. It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls. Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there, um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um So then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons, um the shape of the control, and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control. Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them. Um they're not very attractive to look at, and they're not very comfortable to hold, they're I just hold 'em like big bricks, and they're very easily lost. Um they tend to be very dark colours, so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them. Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme. Um for instance, the stand-by button isn't always red, uh it really should be. It's uh something the user then uh identify with. This is a red switch off, that's how it should be. Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that, but something to look out for. Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that um The buttons should be large. They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones. They should be easy to press, very comfortable. Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them, so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button, that's kinda confusing. Um should avoid s things like that. Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere. Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there, but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea. Fantastic. Um any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden, they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort. Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative, possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice, maybe they got a cold or Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look. That's just wrong. And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department, and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question. So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take and possibility. Right and these are problems I've had with it. Um I don't know where the slogan should go, or really what the slogan is. I think it's um, fashion into electronics. And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is. I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours, but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or That's it. I think I'm cool. Right. Right. Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit. Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably, sort of feels right in your hand. See I'm I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape. Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need. Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here, had a sorta background yellow, and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons. I think that might scare me. I think that'd probably scare me. You turn it on your control possessed s. Um Nah. Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside. B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones, they'd have to go on the the front somewhere. Um Yeah I think so yeah. Mm. Well, but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button, the number part. Uh but Yeah. Mm.
Okay. Okay, well Okay. Okay we all ready to go? Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting. And we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five, and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered, that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories, um. And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything except the T_V_, and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan. Um so that was the last meeting. Is there anything have I forgotten anything? Is that everything? Okay. Um so if we have the three presentations, and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss, maybe just make a note of it, and we'll have all the discussion at the end. That might be a better idea this time. And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David, if that's alright. Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff, right. So if you wanna take this. Screwed in quite tightly. Uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now? We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that? Right. Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product. So um that's kind of the end result hopefully. Uh-huh. Hopefully appear in a wee second. Up there we go. Oh no. Oh right. Here we go. Okay. Mm-hmm. Aye a fair point definitely. Okay. Aye right. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay okay. Mm-hmm. Mm that's true, yeah. Mm 'kay. Great. Okay. Yeah. Ah. Okay. That's great. Uh-huh. Okay great. Um thank you for that. Uh Craig do you wanna uh plug yours in then? Mm. Not quite. Oh something coming now, yeah. There we go. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow, so yellow, lemon, you know definitely food for thought there, but keep going and we'll discuss it after. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm. Aye that's a good idea, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah that that was very good, and uh now with David. I know it'd be handy, wouldn't it. Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber? Yeah. Mm 'kay. Okay. Mm-hmm. I'll clear one of these things for you. Just by moving it yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. W yeah. Uh yeah yeah, I see. Yeah. I know what you mean yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Right can I Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away. Mm. Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Like a phone yeah, like the backlight in a phone. Okay cool. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start, and just giving an id idea on the time, we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most. So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product. So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg, and the corporate colour, and things like that. Um I mean what does everybody think about Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together? I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing, what are your thoughts on that? So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably, or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or So something quite curvy? Okay um right okay. Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it, was that Whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much. Um and when the corporate colour is yellow, I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know. Um And then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work? That's all. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Oh you know like in circular in shape or Choice of material yeah. 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones, and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside, and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch. It feels a bit more comfortable, and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it. And then then we could have curved shapes, 'cause wood or titanium, yeah, it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either. Okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing. A snowman shape? Uh-huh. That's quite a distinctive shape, that would be good wouldn't it. Yeah so yeah should we go with that? Do you wanna draw it on the board? Ooh that'd be good. Mm-hmm. So call it the snowman-shape trademark. Yeah that's cool. Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere. I mean do you want the whole thing yellow, maybe like yellow and white do you want something Uh-huh. Okay cool. Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in? The fact that it talks to you, I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says, what is it, putting fashion into electronics or something, I dunno. Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere. I d I d any thoughts on that at all? I know. Um unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display, where would we put that? Would we put that on the inside or It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot, I would've thought. Yeah. Mm oh yeah that's true. Yeah. So so no need for an L_C_D_ display? I think that would make it very complex. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if there is really, no um I would say no need for a talk-back. Uh does anybody disagree with that? No? Easy. Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities, um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman, body of the snowman, inside of the snowman, is that what you're thinking? Okay. Okay right um what else do you need to talk about? So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about. Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go. Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery, but have have kinetic power, I mean what does anybody think about that? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it, then you're not using any power either. So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly, we don't have as much time as I thought. Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here. Chip on print, is that that's an industrial design thing, is it David? Okay um as for the case, kind of discussed that Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that. Aye that would be a good idea. S so like cur slightly transparent case, so it's yellow, like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it. Is that what you mean? Okay. Lights. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that, couldn't you? If you're holding it in your hand you could Do you think? Okay. Mm. Yeah okay okay um Yeah. Okay. Okay. Just Okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly. Um I'm all for them actually, I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use. So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all? No. And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh ooh okay, we really gotta wrap up so yeah. Okay well if we can do that, great. Yeah okay. Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um, and Mm. Okay. Right I'm gonna have to I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time. Um is there anything anybody's unsure about? Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes, and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing, uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that. So um that'll be that'll be good. Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible. Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing? Okay. That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss, yeah. Okay. Yeah. To make something flush with the case? Okay right. Okay. Sp kinda grippy? Okay. Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time. So um that's really good, like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so. So off you go and design stuff wooh. Yeah quite jealous actually.
'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is, so in that sense so it does kind of make sense, yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. No. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep. It's probably not sending. Yeah. Yep, there it is. And the Play-Doh 's yellow. Cool. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay um. Oops. Yeah okay. Let me just get this going first. Ah there it is. 'Kay, that should be it. Okay um I guess the same thing again, I started with something very basic. So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process, um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are. Um the components are exactly the same. Um I think, like what you guys said, um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface. The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity. Um like you said time to market was a problem, um and how many components are physically in there in cost. And the power is basically a factor of that. Um and the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, and the infrared, um they affect you in terms of the size of your device, um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined, like we only want the basic things that to be visible, and the rest of them we try to hide. So um you know it's just a matter of working out space. So I guess three things, um cost, um complexity, and the size. These are the three things that um will have an impact on you. So just go through it in the components. Um these are the options that are available to you, um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are. Um it said it could talk to you, but it never said anything about being able to listen. I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that. So maybe if you well I could see the other email that they sent you, um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements, or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons, okay and you have a wheel available, like a mouse scroll wheel, okay there's an L_C_D_ display, um I think these are quite standard things. No um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you. I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later. Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks. It can actually be flat or it can be curved, um and then the different types of materials that you can use, um I don't think you can use them in a combination, um but um I could check back for you, but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination. Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine, but plastic, rubber, and wood, I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium. They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium. Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use, but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing, so I think that there is some restriction on um I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together, wood and titanium, but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one. You know as opposed to two. Um and the other components are logic chips, um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips. The com how complex or how easy the logic is, it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost. Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size. Power consumption should be about the same. Um I think the main impact is complexity, um and the other thing is um the power options. Um the first one is a standard battery. Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing, it's a wind-up you know, a crank. Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources. I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing. Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell, which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead. So like what I said, you probably need like a battery and something else. Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think. From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing, it's a shake it it doesn't work, shake it, knock it or something. You know you know you have you had those balls, you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes, you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber. You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it, kind of you know just uh you know um so. Um okay my from my role, I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences, I think um something comfortable to hold, um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't, you know like a phone or something, too small phone. Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit. Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so. Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions. Um The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features, like the buttons are standard okay, the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic. Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels. Okay with the titanium case, let me just check that um, titanium case can't be curved, it has to be square. Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic, and it can't be curved on the wood. So that's again, I don't think you can use them in a combination, um especially the titanium I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need. So um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep. That's it. Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power, and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light so that Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light, or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein, it's alive. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch, like an automatic watch um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it. So you could trigger that to a light, like I said the bouncing ball thing, or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up, right, and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness. I think he made that. Is there a particular shape that you're interested in? Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long? Does it need with a square thing wha Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of Like fruit. I'm thinking fruits in my head, but that's tacky. Do we need an L_C_D_ display? What what's the functionality of that? Yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a Mm-hmm. I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it, so um it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know. Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display, but um it's what's what what would it tell the user, 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user? We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker, is there a need for the remote control to to talk back? Um You could put a game on it. When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control. Where would you physically position the buttons? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things. Um maybe you wanna draw onto the Yep. No, like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing, so it's not gonna charge the battery, it's just Yeah. Yep. Yes yes. Or even a clear case. Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable, but in the dark it sort of, it's alive. Um in in a slight subtle way. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse. You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right. So the power the battery in that sense, maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow, doesn't make it freaky. The question is when you're rolling it, how do you wanna roll it? Do you want 'em to roll it like that? Do you want 'em to roll it like that? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it, whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally. That's a very unnatural motion to yeah. Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot. Um it might work for volume, and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that, but not for channels right. If you have a Telewest box you've got like, you don't have to buy all the channels, you've about fifty channels, can you imagine trying to. Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the I dunno. But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of Yeah. So you wanna expand the shape of the That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in. Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly? Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um Yeah that's what I was thinking the a slide, because then you you don't have to put the hand. I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward. There's lots of space for it um Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function Yeah. Feel like fruit. Fruits kids. No like Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah. Play-doh time. You got to choose first. No, we're kidding. Okay, can I just swipe your power cable, I don't think it matters. Okay lemme okay, I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left. It's you. Argh. This is a real hassle and a oops. I'm gonna take the microphones, 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again. Cool.
@highlight
I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting .
@highlight
decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um .
@highlight
And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan .
@highlight
Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .
@highlight
Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .
@highlight
Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .
@highlight
Number two was that it be innovative .
@highlight
Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .
@highlight
Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture .
@highlight
So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um softness in materials , shape , and function , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , uh sorta like a marketing identity .
@highlight
Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so .
@highlight
Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .
@highlight
Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .
@highlight
Um they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , and they're very easily lost .
@highlight
Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme .
@highlight
The buttons should be large .
@highlight
They should be easy to press , very comfortable .
@highlight
so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing .
@highlight
Um should avoid s things like that .
@highlight
Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .
@highlight
I think it's yellow any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look .
@highlight
and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question .
@highlight
So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is .
@highlight
I think it's um , fashion into electronics .
@highlight
And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is .
@highlight
Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost .
@highlight
And the power is basically a factor of that .
@highlight
Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size .
@highlight
um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .
@highlight
Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .
@highlight
I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .
@highlight
Okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there's an L_C_D_ display , Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks .
@highlight
It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .
@highlight
Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips .
@highlight
The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .
@highlight
Power consumption should be about the same .
@highlight
um and the other thing is um the power options .
@highlight
Um the first one is a standard battery .
@highlight
Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank .
@highlight
I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources .
@highlight
I think whatever it is you still need a battery Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .
@highlight
I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .
@highlight
um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit .
@highlight
Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so .
@highlight
The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .
@highlight
Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels .
@highlight
titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .
@highlight
Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and on the wood .
@highlight
Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?
@highlight
Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .
@highlight
Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone .
@highlight
We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days .
@highlight
Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?
@highlight
um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .
@highlight
Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape .
@highlight
Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .
@highlight
Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .
@highlight
So something quite curvy ?
@highlight
Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much .
@highlight
So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize .
@highlight
Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch .
@highlight
It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it .
@highlight
I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape .
@highlight
Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .
@highlight
So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .
@highlight
also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ?
@highlight
The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I think that'd probably scare me .
@highlight
Would we put that on the inside or Do we need an L_C_D_ display ?
@highlight
It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .
@highlight
what would we what would we achieve from it ?
@highlight
And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings .
@highlight
So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .
@highlight
I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , I would say no need for a talk-back .
@highlight
um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .
@highlight
Where would you physically position the buttons ?
@highlight
Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ?
@highlight
I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .
@highlight
I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .
@highlight
Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .
@highlight
Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .
@highlight
Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse .
@highlight
but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .
@highlight
Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do .
@highlight
Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?
@highlight
The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?
@highlight
'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .
@highlight
Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot .
@highlight
Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right .
@highlight
And and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in .
@highlight
the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that .
@highlight
Yeah I think the jog dial , what if it was flat and you just spun it , a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand .
@highlight
and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .
@highlight
and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .
@highlight
Feel like fruit .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

ES2005b.json,"Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you, however, um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um are a bit uh well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television. So the all in one idea goes out the window. And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four, um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it. So um, presentations, were you anybody got, raring to go? Raring to go? Okay. Good stuff. Mm. Oh I need to plug you in. Just about. Uh there we go, just screw 'em on in. Gonna have to swap them round so now, it was function F_ eight. That's the wee blue one. Blue one F_ eight. Should do it, good one. Hold on, sorry. and if you just click that it'll go ahead, one at a time. Sorry, uh. P press F_ five to start it first. Jesus. Excellent. Oh you wanna go back? Just escape. Okay. Okay. Okay. Speech recognition. Hmm. We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well. Uh, which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual, sort of. Fifteen to twe Okay. Okay, thank you. Um, follow on with Helen? Yeah please. Oh, so we do yeah. Fun and games. Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough. I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well. Okay. Function F_ eight. Hmm. There you go. Uh F_ five. Um, F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing. Uh just a left uh left mouse button. Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay. That can come under Arlo as well. Uh. Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar. Uh okay. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. We hope so. Yeah, particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well. Organic. Mm-hmm. Sales,. Okay. Yeah it's like a, yeah. It's. Right. And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. Um, do you have trouble whistling? Really? Ooh. Yeah, I suppose that's true. Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just, you know, where are you?. Hmm. Sounds good. Function F_ eight for the um the uh Yeah. Alright. Let's remember that. Mm-hmm. But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you. Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there. Ah is that what that is? Well that's cool. If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control, yeah. Right okay. Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated, is it? Yeah. Yeah. Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit, so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time. Okay. Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it, so I don't think it'd up up the price that much. Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah. 'Kay, thank you very much, um I'll take that back. Right, also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting, so didn't manage to forward it on to you, it is let's see, I'll find it myself, um Ta nah. We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated, and everybody uses the internet anyway. Um, dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind. Um it's only for the television, which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television, and um instead of colours and sorta colour options, they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design. Yellow. I presume. Um, everything, all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow. And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean, I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something. Uh, where am I? Okay, so, we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have. Uh, now, we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially, flat screen interface, L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read. We'll use the the basic functions for a television. No teletext. Um okay hold on. Not enough buttons you mean? So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um I do however have this from over my head, that they don't want teletext on it. Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that, or maybe they'll send some information about that, about um what people, whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control. Okay um. So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick. Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display, interactive display. However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um said people didn't like. Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already, sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever, I think maybe that's a bit, going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons, and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons, so it sorta keeps it simple. Um glow in the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material? Okay. So Yeah. Yeah. Lost, yeah. That's cool. That's cool. Okay, cool. Um speech recognition I take it I don't, I've I know of no products um that use speech recognition well. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing. Mm. Uh-huh. Ah, that's a good idea. So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly. Right. That we should just stick on, yeah. Yeah. And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap. Uh-huh. Yeah. It might do us out of a job. Um Okay. I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing. Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that, so I th yeah and expense and the time. So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen. Um, but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem. Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material? Is that Contrast contra well. Yeah, okay. So if it's dow it's d uh yeah. Or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine. Um Okay, well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially, um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well, bright yellow logo in our our um slogan. Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway, and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness. Mm-hmm. Alright, so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback, sort of remote finder, then that kinda stuffs that one out then. Do you think? Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then. Okay. Um, okay so scratch that. Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive? Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself. Um Mm-hmm. Okay. Um no, I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess. Um Uh So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have. Um. So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff, um Uh you were finding out about teletext. If you could find out that uh Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive, no? Oh right, okay. Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right, okay. Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well. Um. Five minutes. Okay. Decisions. Uh, votes, let's vote. Who wants T_F_T_? No-one does. Excellent, so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah? Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head, programmability. Uh Uh o okay. And also, integrating the, remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan. Okay, so. Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well. So, it just helps me summarize them. And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway, so uh Uh pro uh project documents. On A_M_I_ scenario controller. Where am I? Project documents, yeah, it's on your desktop as well. And I will tr getting strings of um information, I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular, as soon as I get them now, rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting, and then the meeting turned up, so I did. So Okay. Yeah. More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of. Oh no, ethics, that's gonna cost us money. Okay, safety. Yeah. It sme smells good for children. That sounds, yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball, yeah, sorry. Please God no. Um. Well, I wouldn't th I mean, my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror, so I think just having it surrounding the logo. Yeah. And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it? We put we put fashion into Whoops, it's not working. Can't believe I've forgotten it. We put the fashion in electronics. I bet that'll catch on well. Okay, any last worries, queries? Okay. S s I know what you're thinking. Okay then, lunchtime, yay. Okay, that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one. This is quite fun actually. I really don't Yeah, yeah. Wow you've your first page. I was just writing really big. I've finished the meeting now. Oh, everybody needs k questionnaire.
Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Wow. So, sorry I was just gonna say, what was the question for this? Or is are you coming on to that? Okay. So these percentages are are what? Hmm. Mm, mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep, sure, that's cool, um Yeah. I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay. Um, yep. Okay, and then what do I press, F_ eight? Oh right. Okay, cool. Oh. Yeah. No signal. Okay. Cool. Okay and then how do I press the the big one, to get it on to the big F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I? Okay, so um I'm the interface design designer, User Interface Designer sorry, uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto, put the fashion in electronics, so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable, it's a big concern of ours. Okay, and how do I press n just the next button? The arrow? Okay. So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like, what people dislike. Um and what people fashionable, because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think. So um what they like and what they find fashionable. And ergonomics, we said um, I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself, but um maybe that comes up, I don't know. And the findings, well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set. That's what people want to do. Um, so they need to be included, um, but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones. I don't know how to get to them, do I press F_ five is it? escape? Oh okay, cool. I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one. These are two leading um remote controls at the moment. You know they're grey, they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons, it's hard to tell from here what they actually do, and they don't look very exciting at all. Um, personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use, it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff, um, but there you go, that's what we're up against, and I think we can do much better than that. Um hang on. F_ five, okay, sorry. Personal preferences. Um, well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important, um Uh-huh. And um I thought not too edgy and like a box, more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and or organic, yeah, more organic shape I think. Um simple designs, like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out, only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons, so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks. Um, hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen, anyway, so um Yeah, no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that, so maybe we forget about that. It's for one T_V_ oh right okay, sure. And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like glow-in-the-dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think. Easy finder with the a whistle function or something, or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries. And I think that, yep, that's it. Okay? Mm-hmm. Um, I haven't been able to Mm-hmm, yeah or some sort of voice Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, something. Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah sure. Well I like that design. Yeah, not a problem. Mm-hmm. Or a little base station or something,. That might cost more though, 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide, well we provide the first batteries, but it's more, it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries. A battery in it, kinda. Okay. Okay. Mm. Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Corporate colour. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Although the the danger with that is, it could look a bit cheap. Yeah. Well Mm. On the number of buttons, kind of functions and stuff. Mm-hmm, okay. Okay, cool. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um Glow in the dark material I was thinking. Um, so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think. Often lost s was that, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually, but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep. If you find if y Yeah. Mm. Yeah, that's the only thing, yeah. That comes with our remote control. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That could also be built into the T_V_ though, which might make our remote control a bit obsolete. Yeah, okay. Mm. And the expense. Mm-hmm. Mm. Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause what I thought, main Slogan, yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. 'Cause yeah, that w more than finding it, that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark, you can um still see the remote control. That was more of a a gimmick. Mm. Yeah, unnecessary. Yeah. Mm. So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen? Yeah you think so? Okay. Mm-hmm, that's cool. Um if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick. Mm-hmm. And where is it sorry? Oh. Okay, cool. Okay. Okay. What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material, but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material, it's a bit more bouncy, like you said they get chucked around a lot. Um, a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls. The rubber rather than Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that, so that's something good, um I dunno, I mean That's a good idea. Interesting. Yeah, d with the colour, um does it have to be all yellow, do you know? No. Yeah. Having a little bit. Okay cool. Mm mm. Mm-hmm, okay. Cool. Oh yeah, that's a good one that. Yeah so. Wow. Has anybo oh. Has anybody pressed okay, it vibrates. It's pretty cool. Yeah, got small writing. I don't wanna waste it.
Yeah. Yeah. Um. So how S Sh do you want me to hold it? So, after that? F_ eight. f oh sorry F_ eight. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, me again, Rajan the Marketing Expert. Uh, as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out, sorry, yeah sure. Yeah, yeah. Uh actually, sorry I have to see the other, sorry. Yeah, thank you. Uh, yes, I have to look at the uh market potential for this product, uh, like consumer likings and everything, what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not? Then Sorry. Okay. Yeah, I can, okay. Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey. A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings, what they prefer what they not prefer, w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things. And what we got was, we found that if you uh, what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market. Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly. They are not so good looking. So, we have to put stress on this, uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design, uh should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. And yes that's wi uh this will definitely, this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales. Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also. So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros, which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls. Then And the second thing, some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls, but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it. Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things. So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also. So we have to take care of this fact also. Then. Uh it was function I want to go to. Uh, escape, okay thank you. Then if we look at this slide, uh these are in your shared documents, you can see, like Uh, sorry. Ah t look all the market potential, what uh how we should design consu our remote controls, what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit, enhance our sales. Yeah, these are different age group persons like uh sorry, I can open it in another way. Uh, yes. If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point, like for speech recognition in a remote control. So we can emphasise on this point also like, because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five, and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group. So we should look Yeah. We can look at that that factor also, so yes. Yeah. So, and And then Yes. I think so. Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market. They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control. So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn. They need not to have any, much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls. So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales. So um this is all about uh market potential by me. Uh, yes, th thank you. Yeah we have to take that out. Sorry. Sorry. Uh sorry, I have. Brian, this one also I. Yeah. Thank you very much Brian. If you want me to help, yeah. Yeah. Uh F_ eight. Function F_ eight. Mm s. It's not coming. Function F_ eight, okay. Yeah. Computer. Computer adjusting, yeah. Yeah. Escape. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Fifty million was uh prof As a profit. Yeah, me too. Yeah. About cost. Okay. Uh. I Uh may I say something about? Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote, in the room. But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time. But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control, like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark. Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control, and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales, so we should take it into consideration also. Yeah. Totally, it takes cheap speech recognition, she they wi Yeah. Glow in dark. Here? Sure. Uh it is in shared documents? Projoct uh projector. Hmm. It is not giving anything. Shared documents. Um but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful. So, whatever material we use it should be yeah. So we have to safety point of view also, we have to take care. Yeah. Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it. Yeah. Hmm. That's good. Check here.
It's a inspired design. Hmm. Of course. So uh, I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling, and uh I was just curious to know, have we done any research into how many people can whistle? Um, or if is that a function we want in the remote? I don't, but I I know a lot of people do right. Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too, right? That's costly though. Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um, shouting, you know, uh and then, what would the response be? It beeps back at you or something? Okay. Well, uh let me set this up. So I plug it in, press F_ five? Function F_ five? Or function F_ eight? Okay. Okay. I think it's uh just to lock it in. It's got it. Okay. Um. So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys, um so it's good you went first, and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others. Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products, and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour. Um, a lot of the buttons aren't used, and uh he mentioned that they're not fun to use. And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote, there could be a little microphone on it, and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort. Oh yeah, yeah, that's true. Well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes. Um. Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um, and then as for the user interface it should be trendy, um and not computery, right, so more low tech and not too many buttons. So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss. Right um, and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window. And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before, which include, you know, um space craft, coffee makers, and bullet trains Or uh or a high speed train. Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these. Right. So, I figured, just put 'em all together. You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_, and um as for the user interface problem, you know, too many buttons. Give it one button and and it's a you know, for the the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a Right. So I think I I missed the budget thing, it was fifty million Euros? And we gotta sell twenty five of them? Right. Okay. Oh okay, so I I mixed those numbers. Okay. Well I guess more realistically then, we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing, cheap plastic uh, you know, um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less. An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um, we don't wanna have it Uh. Yeah, yeah, we could do that too. Um, I hadn't thought of that. Yeah. Right. Right, so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons, but since we're a cutting edge company, we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition, whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product. Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh, just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about. Um so here's you know, a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me. Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that. And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences, I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory, uh non volatile memory, just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting. Oh okay. And the uh, the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know, they take more budgeting, um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles. That's all I got. Ooh that's tight. Okay, I don't think we need to screw it in. Just push it. Yellow. Yeah yeah. Well hmm. Oh it's They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it. You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel. Yeah, it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem. They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one. Right, right, and so there was a lot of this, you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something, but if you can work around that that noise problem Right. Right and then it would do just you know, uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise. What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker, or not a remo I'm sorry, a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote, 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s. But yeah, then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker which Right, and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television. Right, right. Right, right. Um. Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again. If you do have this sorta speech interface to it, you don't even need to find it. You just say you know, um whatever you whatever you want the remote for, you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off, you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know, within hearing range. And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job. Well, hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve. Hmm. Um. Mm. Yeah, no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know, and then uh if you're, if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now, I I think Yeah. Well, I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot, you know they get thrown around, there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged. They're pretty fragile. Yeah mm. Oh. Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_, it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits. And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system, like a Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah. So it should be when you save on your desktop, so it goes save as, or And then uh hit that little folder up thing again. Again. All the way to the top, yeah that's up to desktop. Right and then project documents. Mm. Did you get my email? Okay. Just making sure. Yeah. Wow. We could go comp yeah. We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball. And it's got the thing on the inside. And there's no buttons at all, it's always on, and just yell at it, and it works. And then ch children will love it. Oh yellow, yellow ball. Right. Twelve thirty. Mm. Yep. Yeah I've been using up the pages. Another questionnaire.
@highlight
well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television .
@highlight
So the all in one idea goes out the window .
@highlight
now , it was function F_ eight .
@highlight
f oh sorry F_ eight .
@highlight
and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time .
@highlight
Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey .
@highlight
Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .
@highlight
uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .
@highlight
Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also .
@highlight
but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .
@highlight
Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , Oh you wanna go back ?
@highlight
Just escape .
@highlight
If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .
@highlight
because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
No signal .
@highlight
Computer adjusting , yeah .
@highlight
Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing .
@highlight
uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .
@highlight
but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones .
@highlight
These are two leading um remote controls at the moment .
@highlight
I mean this one's got loads of buttons , Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .
@highlight
was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries .
@highlight
and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?
@highlight
is that a function we want in the remote ?
@highlight
you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ?
@highlight
.
@highlight
Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , uh and then , what would the response be ?
@highlight
It beeps back at you or something ?
@highlight
Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .
@highlight
So I plug it in , press F_ five ?
@highlight
and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .
@highlight
And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .
@highlight
But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .
@highlight
and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .
@highlight
So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ?
@highlight
so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .
@highlight
Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries cheap plastic uh , you know , Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?
@highlight
Yeah , yeah , we could do that too .
@highlight
Or a little base station or something , .
@highlight
uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .
@highlight
Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .
@highlight
uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .
@highlight
And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .
@highlight
Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .
@highlight
Um it's only for the television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .
@highlight
Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow .
@highlight
And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .
@highlight
speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display .
@highlight
Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?
@highlight
But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .
@highlight
but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .
@highlight
You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range .
@highlight
I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing .
@highlight
we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .
@highlight
there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged .
@highlight
So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have .
@highlight
Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .
@highlight
so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ?
@highlight
Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design .
@highlight
Glow in dark .
@highlight
if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .
@highlight
And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan .
@highlight
getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , Um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .
@highlight
And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the We put the fashion in electronics Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one .

I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager. Uh No, I'm doing the interface. Yeah I I'm I'm Well, maybe we have okay so I industrial design. It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright. Yeah. User. Well, I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the Well, w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess. So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh how we can make it work. Yeah, I dunno I Yeah. Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting, or Yeah. Well, you have to make it work. That's the that's the big thing. Yeah. We can think about an interface with uh well Yeah, yeah. I I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno Yeah. Yeah. On the content. Yeah, yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to Yeah yeah. Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way, so Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Yeah, yeah. So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Oh right so Please, Norman, draw uh Okay. Yeah, by content or by channel, it's a good idea. And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents. Yeah. I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting. Okay. Thank you everybody. Okay.
Good morning. Or you can put it in the shared folder. No, I didn't get it. This one. No. No,. I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information. Yeah I think assign your uh roles. For each person, yeah. Uh, I'm into marketing. yeah nothing much in the project. Marketing in this design. A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface. Yeah, this is. Yeah, that's right, first. us user define. There's a trend watching. Yeah. I mean working remotes we already have. This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls. Yeah, that's right. I'm a okay. I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control. If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it. And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself. I need not have an I mean we have some or something, different technology but Mm-hmm, yeah. And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So, I mean, if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene, the lights adapt themself. The lighting in the room changes. I mean, we have a option in the remote control. If we want to have that option, you press that button in the remote. Oh, I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel. The lapel. Yeah, that one. Just plug it. Yeah, that's right.
Hmm. Good morning. Mm. B did you send us an email about this? Yeah, we we received an email about this uh d designs. Ah it's Okay. Yeah, you see the email? You email. The v very no, no the first one. It's inside. No, no. The third one. Oh, you didn't get anything. It's strange. Mm. I got an email about the dis about the discussion. Yeah. I dunno from who. From the account manager. You have received the same email, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so each of us has a role to do. In each We already have our role. 'Kay, we can So there are three kinds of designs, that's all. Okay, alright. Yeah, yeah. I'm doing the interface. Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay. Mm? Um working on i. User interface. Yes. You see the second mail? Yeah, it's inside. Go down. Appendix. See there's a role for everybody. Even for the marketing. But look at your role, your marketing role. Yeah, that's your role. Mm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Need to collect information. Um. I I'm part of design, perhaps. Uh, what is most important in a in a remote control? What is the most important function aspect? Uh. That's alright. Yeah, it should be easy to work with. Yeah. Uh. We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface. You just tell the television I want which channel. Or or you can say for example, um I want uh to list all the programme tonight. Y you know, instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you, so you don't have to look for the channel you want. Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight. Or a button for all the magazines, all the information documentary tonight. And then you list a few, and I will choose from the list. So instead of pressing the channel number, I am choosing the programmes directly. Yeah, that's one way of uh making it useful. No, because no, it's not very a lot. Th this information exists. For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but uh and it's more natural. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, possible. Yeah. But Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel, there's a option you can choose, either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. So it's more powerful. Yeah. No. No, because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs. They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format. We don't care. We just say that this are some content. We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes. Some of the websites they already provide this service, so we can just use the service available. Download it uh to the to this remote control. And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories, or sev seven. The most there are only seven buttons. So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button, for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want, so you don't have to choose among hundred channels, if you have hundred channels, you just have six buttons, seven buttons. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Ah, yes. So. Yeah. Yeah, so you don't have to display here, just display on the T_V_ screen, right? Good idea. Okay. I think I think that will be revol revolutionary. Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers, lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board. Five minutes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but we are designing just remote control. Okay. Okay, do you want to have a conceptual remote control there, or you just want to put the function in? Go on, draw something. Mm. Where is it? Ah, okay. Where where is it? Here. Mm. Mm. Okay, alright. So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content. Right? We agree on that, right? Uh, uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons. Uh to choose uh content s or channels. So we have both. The user can choose w which one they want, right? By content or by channel. Choose by contents or by channels. So And then what did we say just now? Other than this. Okay, so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content. Challenge. Okay. Content. Okay, so these we have to work it out. So this one of the problem. And uh The main thing. Okay. Alright. Alright, okay. So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting, so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer? That's the first aspect. Right. We will get information and then we'll come back in.. Yeah, we'll come. Alright. Alright, okay. Thank you, mis
Good morning everybody. So, we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television. And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly. So people can can use it without any any problem.. I don't know. Uh, not yet, but if you want Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? Or Uh. You get email,. S For each for each one. So there are so we have three f yeah. We have functional design, conceptual design, and detail design. So, who will be the the responsible for the functional design? Any any volunteer? You are doing th. Okay, I'll for industrial design. Okay. And and you Norman? And And doing the marketing. Nothing related here to the Next. I don't know. I. About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later, no? Mm-hmm. What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics. And of course it should not be very costly. So About the about what? You mean the external or Yeah of g of course. Yeah. You won't I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly. S Like s uh you you you say we can use speech. In the hand. Yeah. Except if if you are far from the T_V_. This is it's Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons. This is good idea. So we have five minutes to Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so, can we S You it. Yeah. If if you you you can if you want you can use th the. Or before the before the the design that says. Norman. Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm. Okay. So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes? And we'll discuss the other other aspects. Okay. Well thank you all.

So , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television .
@highlight
Yeah , so each of us has a role to do .
@highlight
Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh B did you send us an email about this ?

we will get some information in the next meeting , We will get information and then we'll come back in .

IS1005b.json,"Okay, can I have the laptop over here, or? Okay. Have to get up. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Okay, so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control. Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects. Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to, you know, um play with remote controls, and also to complete, after they'd done that, to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls. So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market. Um they, you know, seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on, found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly. Completely ugly. Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user, that is, you know, the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_. Um, that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it. Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls. Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control. And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons, the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control. Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average, um, while the user's watching T_V_. Um the closest button that was used, well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button, um which was used fourteen times per hour, followed by the volume button, which was four times per hour, um, all the other, all the other um buttons, such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used, you know, l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour. Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them, you know, which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control. And basically they came they said the channel, volume, and power buttons had the highest relevance to users, um note that only power was very infrequently used, it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour, but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance. Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um, and they used them very infrequently a as well. So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls. And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it. Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control, especially when there's many buttons and it's a, you know, a c a a unintuitive interface. Um and then thirdly, they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury. We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control. In particular, do they want an L_C_D_ d display, and secondly, do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control. Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes. They want these features, they want these high technology features. Um for instance, ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes, they want these features. Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control. So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market. Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics, um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic, and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control. That's my dic that's my presentation. Thank you. Yeah, it's true, but, you know, they're features that users want, so it's And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think, so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote. It is true. That's the wrong one, I think. Okay. I have a question. Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home? Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit, or are we planning to construct our own circuit board? Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and Okay. Okay. Okay. What how much more expensive? Are we talking three times more expensive? Or ten times more expensive? Or Okay. Yeah yeah. That's still a lot. I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money, because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red, so people don't expect anything other than infra-red. So it's not worth spending the extra money. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above, you know, the difference between infra-red or radio waves. So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase. Okay. Mm. Well, should we start with just the core, the basic functions that we need. And then we can move on to the more advanced features. Okay, well, I mean the obvious one is changing channels. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I Ah yeah. To have some feedback. Yeah. We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume, with the channel. So we c you could quickly just through many channels. For the channels, perhaps. So we've got channel and volume. Um. I think so. I think basically the core functions we want, and then more advanced ones. Yeah. I don't Oh, I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones. I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s, I think. Okay. But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time. I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere, under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have five minutes left. Um. So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required. It's just how to a Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh, okay, what else? I mean a power button's obviously uh required. Uh, well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off. But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours, you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute I mean based on our usability studies again, um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button. Um, you know, it was nine out of ten re relevance. Okay. B Okay. I think we need to concentrate on the, you know, the major usage of the th of the control, which is you sit down, you turn on your T_V_, you change channels, you change the volume, you turn the T_V_ off. Um and all the other f functionality is not used very often. Yeah. I think a button. I think it should be a bu Its own button on the front. Okay. S What about things like the clock and um timers? Uh um, you know, some func some features on the control to display a time, or t to display Probably not. It's a questi yeah, it's a trade-off. 'Kay. Okay simple. Very, yeah okay, very occasionally. But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often, but Yeah. Yeah that's okay, that's true. Okay, so no time button. Okay. Okay, cool. Okay Thank you.
Okay. B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager. Okay. Okay. If I could go there with this cable. Sh okay. Where's delete button? Okay. Oh I'm sorry. Okay. Oh. Presentation three? Oh. Okay, so here is my presentation about technical function design. I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together. Okay, uh, first what is a remote control? Simply it's a device, as you know, for uh, for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device. And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device. Uh i it has different blocks, different blocks. Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands. And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands, uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands. And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever, to uh r to realise the command. Okay, uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh, usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control. They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves. There are two different uh uh solutions I mean. This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves, infra-red or radio waves. And uh also as uh I understood, and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob, uh uh presentation, people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button. So for the electronic part, working and interfacing, with button, we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options, and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control. And uh personal preferences, uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way. And uh uh again, using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred, as I see. Okay. That was my presentation. Uh-huh. Uh, I don't think so, because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency. So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home. Uh no but as I know, there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff, for designing this circuit. We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range, and for this range we don't need to ask any permission. Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution, but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave, so the only your T_V_ can understand it Yeah, identification code inside the The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem. A specific uh remote control has a specific f Mm. Mm-hmm. Five. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah yeah, at least nine, ten button. Or Or something. Mm-hmm. Okay. Like categorising channels. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design. Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels, some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah. Yeah b Not on the control, on the screen, on the T_V_ screen. And then Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Settings. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this. Like covering cu. Yeah, like mobile phone covering. A button is better. Yeah. Mm. Clock or Yes. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm. And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands, or? I I thin I think it will not take lots of place, we just need a microphone and the software, so, and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting, so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone. It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much. Mm-hmm. Thanks.
Yeah, that's it. Well, okay, yeah. Yeah, but the user user interface is responsible. Okay, so. You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man. And speech recognition in remote unit, it will be very e expensive. Yeah. Yeah. At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally. Because you cancelled it. Yeah. Yep. You still want me the presentation. Yeah, it should be okay. Yeah f uh I know about this, since it's my it's exactly my field, so. It's uh kind of handshaking, uh, when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote. So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen. Well it can be a problem sometimes, but most of the time it works okay. Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy. It's worth to buy. And they have these problems solved so. So we don't have to think about these. Yes. I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company. I was used to use Linux before, so. But I tried to tried to break through this too, I guess. Mm. Ah. Okay. How to make it big? Slide show. Okay, thanks. Okay. Oh so I will speak about working design. That's the first slide. Uh what uh I have to do? A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use, what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on, so I'm currently looking what is available on the web. And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards, after after our discussion, if we have some contacts in some companies, so, which can report on what is going on there, so, I would be glad if you can tell me about them. So, you know. Uh, okay findings, that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit, I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now, but the prices I read are high. So, I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on, but you know, when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe. Uh. Components to use, I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit. It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition, because the speech rec Yeah? No no no no no. This we this we buy I think, because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves. Exactly. But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition. This I prefer that we should make ourselves. But it depends whether we take a decision to use it. Same thing. It's fairly expensive to use these circuits. So, speech recognition well, L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_, so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_, less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit. But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer, you know. Yeah, I'm Oh. I was not thinking too much about the price. But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff, it should be okay. If we decide to use the speech recognition, then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards. It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_, I'm sorry about the names, I don't really know, uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic, these things, it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that, so. We will discuss it afterwards. Oh, this is nothing. This is just my notes on what to use. And uh my personal preference is yes, I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit, but from the point of view uh of the design and price, I would stick to I_R_s. That's my opinion. Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency. Because because the the range where you can use it is fair. It's okay I think. And the price is fairly cheap for this. Well, depends. Jus just the price. Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy. So I I I think it's o y o. Well, three to three to five. N not ten times, but it depends what what we Yeah. Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so, I don't know. You the user interface, and management man, uh Uh okay, that's it for me. 'Kay. I agree. Okay, so the available things are L_C_D_, the buttons and everything. Uh radio frequency depends. And, well the recognition it depends on you guys. You should probably speak. Okay. Uh just one note to the chan channel changing. Do we will we use only two buttons, or or like numbered buttons? I mean those nine plus one or two? Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number. Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons. Like ten plus, five plus, one plus, one minus or something. Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno. You mean like hierarchical structure. Okay, so s Oh sorry. So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably, to to tell you Okay, so I'll make a note on L_C_D_. Yeah. Like roller for the Yeah. Okay. So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one? On the screen, you mean? Not on the control, but on the screen. Well, this would avoid L_C_D_, then. Oh. W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things. Well it wi it will be still more expensive, but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price. Two T_V_s. Like ma We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode. Or I dunno. Or like children and grandfather's mode, and the, well the the user not the user, the man mana T_V_ manager mode. Ah, I dunno. Uh. Yeah. Hide them, okay. Um. Yes. This I was thinking. Do we need a power button at all? Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it? Because generally Yes. Well I I uh You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive. Uh probably. Okay, so we should keep this button. Okay, so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff, we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it, it will turn off the T_V_. If if you like this, Because, well it's maybe question for you t Yeah. I mean like the Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_, we didn't need too much button too many buttons. Um, okay, just um the decision of the power button. Should we make it a button, or some some something which would be Uh power button. If it if it's a button or Okay. Okay, one nice big button. Old fashioned button, to satisfy the grandmothers. Hmm. Mm. Do we still have the time? I I just wonder. Okay. Oh. Well what w what was the question? Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions, and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote, no? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself, it well you know, if the time The timer should be there. Ah, yeah. Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_, well And based on your Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote. Yes yes. Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life, then. If we use the speech recognition. Yeah.
So um nice to see you again. Uh. So, uh. Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes. Uh so we will see our three presentations. Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements, whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device. Yep. Oh, I don't think so. I think you have to come here. I dunno. I think it should stay. Should stay in the square here. Oh, maybe. Oh, you can put it here. Oh that's okay, it's jus Hmm. Thank you. So, um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device. So uh Pet Peter, can you talk say something about that? No. Ah. Sorry, I'm Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, it's still Bob Morris. Yeah you should have put yes. Click on yes. yeah. So can we use any any frequency? We have the right to use any frequency? Okay. And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control, for example? And so do they have the same frequency, or? Okay. A kind of identification, okay. So Yeah. So Okay. Hmm. Okay. So, maybe you can talk about the function, and Open. Slide show. It should work, so you can. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think would be the price, it would be out of range? Or it would be maybe feasible? Okay. Mm. Why? Because it's simpler? Yeah. Mm. Okay. It's a a price matter. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I, oh On the other side, we want to have something new. You know, where we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it. But maybe. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay, thank you Peter. So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control. Um first um, they say that's uh about something about t teletext. Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date. Out-dated. And uh Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home, and actually it's not useful to have teletext. Um. So I think we can avoid the teletext. Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_, not for D_V_D_ and other devices, because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control. The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company. So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable. Uh, uh It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company, which is uh, we put fashion of in electronics. So, when people see the the remote control, they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company. So, um So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control. So, mm, are we going to use L_C_D_, speech recognition? Uh. Yeah. Maybe, maybe. Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control? I mean what do Yeah. Yeah. I think we should stick on very useful functions, because we want less button. So, yeah. So, turning channel, of course. Volume setting. Yeah. I think it would be a b Yeah. On the other side we have more and more channels, and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want, it's Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens, like uh Yeah. Maybe something like that. Uh. Maybe Oh I don't know. Oh. Maybe we could have key buttons, like uh discovery channe like documentary channel, and movies channel and And inside this this thing you can move, maybe switch. If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus. I It just an idea. I don't know what you think about that but. Yeah, probably, yeah, yeah. Okay. Anything else? Yeah. Yeah. What about the settings of the T_V_? Because it's button we don't use very often, but it's we need it anyway. So Yeah, yeah. I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ Yeah. Yeah. So, what are we doing with the settings? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons, so. Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons, but Mm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, the. Yeah. Yeah. We should hide them somewhere. In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control, or something like that. It's it's a kind of setting, I think. It should fit in those settings functions. Because it's not a very current useful function. No, I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer I I think, no? Oh okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So s yeah. Yeah. On the back, or For what? Ah oh yeah, yeah. Yeah a button, yeah I guess so. So, any other suggestions or functions? Yeah, we have still one or two minutes to talk, yeah. Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we if we add the time, we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that, and is it very useful? I mean, are users wants to have the time on the on the remote? This is the question. Is it useful? W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better. No time on. I think Yeah. So maybe we think we can think more about that, and discuss that maybe last time next time. And uh yeah, now the meeting room is busy. Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_, and so we should leave. Uh. So, um. So now we are going for for a small lunch. It's uh funded by the company. And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works. And uh I will do the minutes. And uh you are going to work on your individual works. And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on. Thank you everybody.
@highlight
Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .
@highlight
Uh so we will see our three presentations .
@highlight
Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
@highlight
Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .
@highlight
So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .
@highlight
seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .
@highlight
Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls .
@highlight
And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .
@highlight
And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .
@highlight
In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .
@highlight
Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .
@highlight
So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market .
@highlight
And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .
@highlight
And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .
@highlight
Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design .
@highlight
Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .
@highlight
And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air Okay , uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control .
@highlight
They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .
@highlight
uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .
@highlight
And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see .
@highlight
Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?
@highlight
Uh , I don't think so , And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ?
@highlight
but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company .
@highlight
so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know .
@highlight
If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle And And the price is fairly cheap for this .
@highlight
because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .
@highlight
But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .
@highlight
So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control .
@highlight
Um Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .
@highlight
Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , the third one is uh about the the the image of the company .
@highlight
It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics .
@highlight
So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control .
@highlight
Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .
@highlight
And then we can move on to the more advanced features .
@highlight
I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .
@highlight
So , turning channel , of course .
@highlight
Volume setting .
@highlight
will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?
@highlight
Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .
@highlight
so so we keep all these all these buttons .
@highlight
Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .
@highlight
So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .
@highlight
So we've got channel and volume .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , We should hide them somewhere .
@highlight
I mean a power button's obviously uh required .
@highlight
This I was thinking .
@highlight
Do we need a power button at all ?
@highlight
Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .
@highlight
Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?
@highlight
Okay , so we should keep this button .
@highlight
so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be A button is better .
@highlight
What about things like the clock and um timers ?
@highlight
If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?
@highlight
Probably not .
@highlight
W In my opinion we should have only useful thing So , um .
@highlight
So now we are going for for a small lunch .
@highlight
And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works .
@highlight
And uh you are going to work on your individual works .
@highlight
And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .","```

ES2008a.json,"Hmm. Yes. Well. Oh my god, it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do. Take my contraptions with me. Alright, I'm Jessy. I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_. And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on, animal. Don't really know how to draw this. Just where can I Mm. Mm. Maybe if I do the water, but how? Sort of give an idea. I have no idea how one would explain this. Mm maybe with some whiskers. Briefly, it's supposed to be a seal. You can imagine it in the water. I like them, because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time. Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that. It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it. That's impressive. Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going, I don't know. Now they keep combining all different remotes together, and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload. I just wanna watch the T_V_ um. Always gets lost. Some sort of like device to help you find it. Yeah. What about like batteries and things like that, like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And maybe that spatially divides it, so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it, but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here, then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together, 'cause then you like, I don't even know what I'm turning on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm hmm. I think it's just T_V_, I mean, if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say. You know, things might be more advanced than that. It's an idea with the buttons being really. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm four.
Uh Okay. Well, my name is Iain uh and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project. Um. And I'll try and draw my favourite animal. I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off. Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um. Is that at least identifiable? It's a whale, yes. Thanks. Um and, yeah, the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well, first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious, like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work, how they form groups. And I just find them interesting animals. Cool. I've used, I've used remote controls, for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh. You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel. So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice. Um. I find them they can be a bit annoying, especially, like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me, you know, one for the T_V_, one for the digital box, one for m the video recorder as well. Um. And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing, they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off, change the channel, change the volume. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Can I ask, are we designing a remote control for a television only um, and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it? Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it? So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control. Well, I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting? Do we know that? Right. Yep. Yep. Okay. Can you e-mail your slides as well? Is that possible? Cool. 'Kay
Alima. Okay. Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me. Right, so, I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal. I have no drawing skills whatsoever. But uh let's see, introduce myself. My name is Alima Bucciantini. Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US. I'm doing nationalism studies, blah, blah, blah, and I have no artistic talents. A_ L_ I_ M_ A_. Oh, and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project. So let's see if I can get um here. I will draw a little turtle for you all. Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal, but just that I think they're drawable. And you have the pretty little shell going on. Some little eyes. Happy. There you go. That's a turtle. Um. I I like the whole having a shell thing. It's quite cool carry your home around where you go, um quite decorative little animals, they can swim, they can, they're very adaptable, they carry everything they need with them, um and they're easy to draw. No, you can erase the turtle, it's alright. Snake. Well, snake? It's w Oh, a cat. Yeah. Right. That's That's pretty impressive. Yeah um. I agree with having too many remotes around. My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things, and I don't know how to work half of them um. What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons, they are not too small, you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing. And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red. Um, I think there is a way around that, but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on, so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself, and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing. So I know. Yeah, something that doesn't Mm. Yeah. Could we get something that just has No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about, but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off, channel changing. Yeah. N that way Yeah. Yeah, and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. Um. Yeah. Mm. Right. Mm. Mm yeah. Yes. I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for. If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler, 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it. Large. If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it. Hmm. Yeah. 'Kay. I'm sure we'll be busy. I'm two. Alright. 'Kay.
Okay. Good morning everybody. Um I'm glad you could all come. I'm really excited to start this team. Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us, for our kick-off meeting. My name is Rose Lindgren. I I'll be the Project Manager. Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project, then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise. And then we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion and close, since we only have twenty five minutes. First of all our project aim. Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about, it needs to be original, trendy and user-friendly. I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those. Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts. First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptional design, individual work and a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work and a meeting. So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating. Okay, we're gonna get to know each other a little bit. So um, what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina. Um Alima, sorry, Alima. Um we're gonna do a little tool training, so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you. Um introduce yourself, um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it. Probably both. How do you spell your name? Thanks. So what are your favourite characteristics? Mm. Excellent. Shall we just go around the table? Mm. Might be nice to have them all up there at same time. Em Mm 'kay. Mm 'kay? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager, from California. Um. Hmm. S Um it's actually a coyote. Let's see. Let's see, let's give it a little bit of a snout, I don't know, some teeth. Yeah. Oh dear. Yes. I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California. We have coyotes howl all the time. So I really enjoy their their singing, you they're really beautiful animals. Mm. Okay um, moving on to slightly more serious stuff. We're gonna talk about project finances. Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet, like it's an international market range, we don't have to worry about specifics. Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro. So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for. Okay um, just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um, I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls, um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control, what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like, etcetera, so Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Um I would imagine all of them, but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s. Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing. Um. Um. Okay, it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote, and yet you don't wanna have five remotes. So how do we work with that? Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Okay, so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things. Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well. So like you have to have them somewhere, 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally. Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote. Good question. I don't know that yet. It's a good question. Um. I'll look into that. If I can. Mm. Mm. Okay. 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas. Mind if we move on? Ps mm okay. Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes. I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty, so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um, but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually. Um the industrial design, Alima will be doing um the working design. Um the User Interface Designer, that's for. Technical functions, I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing, the size of the buttons. Um user requirements um, so you'll be hearing about different trends, uh about different things that people need, um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having, we'll get from the actual consum s consumers. Mm 'kay um. And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach. I realised in this past one we we didn't have much, we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done. Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um. Any questions? I haven't gotten an agenda yet, um I'll put that together. I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together. So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you. Um just including all the things that we talked about. Um. Yes, I yes, I think I can. Mm-hmm. I'll just attach it to an email. And you're you're number two, three, four? Is that correct? Okay. Excellent. It was lovely meeting you all. Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails. Let me see if I can do that right now. Mm 'kay.

IS1007c.json,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh. But people are often enough looking at the help, once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff. It's a psychology. Okay. And let us see what the market demands. We could just go to my presentation. Yeah that's right. I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the Same remote with some Both yeah. And then we can decide what what we can yeah. So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes. And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires. Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions. And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design. So seventy percent of the users, they find their remote controls very ugly, they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything. And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy. And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot. And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons, so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times. So this were the findings which we found. And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls. Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_. And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished. So they're frustrated a lot And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it. So you can just see the percentage, fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex. So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them. We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control. Mm-hmm? I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy. So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote, rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it. It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control. We just play around Yeah. Yeah. I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands. So the other one Yeah that's fine. Yeah. I mean that's Mm-hmm. Uh yeah we have uh I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers. And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls. Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary, say eighty commands or so. Mm, the scroll button, from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button. Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button. Yeah. They're not used much. Or it could be like this, as the people say, if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television. Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background, we are most focused on the commands. So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote, you just have a menu, and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu, in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume, then the program, then the brightness, contrast and all the stuff. And accordingly you can just increase or decrease. Yeah that has to be checked out. Yeah. Okay. I mean, better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition. And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case. And the third problem was to find the remote control. Always, so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes. So Yeah that's right, that's exactly what I mean by voice commander. Or it could be also something like this, uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control, so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger. And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps, wherever it is. I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command, because there are problems with a voice command. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged. Yeah that's right. It's an good reminder, yeah that's right. And of course the final point is a fancy look. As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy, I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons. I think we should have something it I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it, you can't avoid him. But you can have an button for child lock. So just by pressing the button with some code, you t you put a lock onto the remote, so that he can't use even Mm uh That's right. I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included. No, we have a problem there. You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something, and if the score comes twenty four thirty five, you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five. So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five. Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent. So it's better to have some prefix before the number. Yeah something, some code. That will be too big. And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also. Als might be you just forgot the channel name, you kno only know the number. Then Yeah, the. Yeah yeah,. Yeah. A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem. If we are using the television in the different environments, say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work, that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company. So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands, say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something. Yeah that's right that should be an option. I think these are the practical problems. So we need to take care of them in the design. Okay. Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay. Okay. See you another thirty minutes.
Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh I'm participant two. Components design. Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control. So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy, hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy. We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control. Now Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote. So uh it's a point to discuss. Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices, like wood, rubber, titanium or latex. But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view. Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated, but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so. And uh this is the last point, the choice of chips. So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment. So um so I think we can start with these two main things. For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote. For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons, simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper. And s so uh we can move to the next slide. Yeah. Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote. You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the Yeah. It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat. Yeah the um that's the point. The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy. But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy. Yeah. And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please. So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said. So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy. That's it. Oh yeah I take care, it's all right. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm mm mm. Yeah fine. Yeah. S a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control. Yeah yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that, because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also, so. Yeah. That's a good idea. To have a help button. Yeah. On the T_V_ screen. On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote. Uh yeah. In a marketing point of view. But uh wel well I think Uh well. So le le let's see what uh what people want. Yeah. Yeah. Mm, the functionalities yeah. Yeah. Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen. It's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you, s Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results. So price of uh L_C_D_ display. And Yeah. Yeah okay. And Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button. Yeah. Yeah I think that Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality. Yeah. But But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you Yeah. But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient, one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that. You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh Yeah but Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at, so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t Yeah. Yeah. Put Yeah. And that's a good idea, that's simple, like in phones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery. Also and uh uh the remote is lost. Yeah. Okay. They were ugly. They Well the last one with the um yeah with the two parts was uh original, so Yeah. Yeah. Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category, if it is kids, uh things like that. So for mm yeah. So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use, where to use, and s uh and so on. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh That's right, yeah, yeah. Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so. Yeah yeah. Yeah but well okay. Yeah yeah. Mm mm. Well I Yeah. Well I uh I also I I also think about uh another problem, if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two. Because uh I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run, s Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also, so. Okay. Okay. So I see ya.
Mm. Mm. Mm. Sorry. What is this single curved what does it mean? So it's it's not Yo l yeah. When you hold on it, it is comfortable to hold. Okay. Yeah. And the battery, is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter? That that's what it means by kinetic. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. Mm mm. Wha Ah the department. Mm. Uh So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department. So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not. 'Cause I am not very sure, plastic, titanium or whatever. There's another point I want to make, is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use Yeah. Yeah, maybe n Yeah. So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system, a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data. So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here. The idea is to represent buttons as figures, diagrams, symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing. Yeah. Yeah. So. Ea easy to use. So next one. function five. So I can use the button, the mouse maybe. Yeah. So next line. So the here are some examples. So they cluster the buttons together. They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well. Mm but this interface are kind of confusing. Uh basically there are too many buttons. Right. Next one. So some people are propose voice recognition and so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you. So I just got an email saying that. And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that, supposedly. The next one. Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons, you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well. Touch screen, I mean. Next one. And some people propose a scroll button. Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button. Like the one we have here. Uh, next one. So mm so there are a few aspects that I collected here. So s basically this deals with special users, children, handicapped people, old people, and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable, specially for children. And uh mm yeah yeah. And then they also secure uh covers, to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings. So But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features. I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people. Yeah, so that's the point. The next one. And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover. Mm maybe useful for children, they migh you you they only see the buttons outside. And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside. So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside. Yeah. The next one. So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons. At I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost. But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use. And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is. T_V_ remote controller where are you? And then, he will beeps and to say that I am here, for example. Is it possible? Uh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume. So there's a up arrow and a down arrow. But you the see that in the V_, the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface, so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design. And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found. Big buttons are convenient, voice recognition helps, push buttons, scroll buttons, spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools. And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key. Yeah. So we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used. And basically uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Okay. A help button. So you are display on the screen. So on the T_V_ screen. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that eliminates all the complicated documentation, okay. So wi Yeah. Mm. Mm. Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller, i it could be a cube, is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons, if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons, you turn the other side you get the other buttons, so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls. Small Yeah. Let's see the market demand. What what market yes yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Oh. Big screen. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm. The thing Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you re-use the existing screen, we element eliminate the L_C_D_, after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful, fancy, as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_, maybe even better. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. More on a fancy design. Yeah. Mm. Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller. Yeah. So i is so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again. Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time. Is i if i Yeah. Yeah. And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. Yeah. Yeah. And ho Yeah. And also the scroller button, how much will it cost. Yeah. Don't use the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Important. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, yeah. So so the at most more power uh. Yep. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. I if Mm. Mm. Yeah. I think that there's no contradiction here, because if there are few buttons, you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are, so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel, if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel, just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_, with the help of speech recogniser you can Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. A and Mm. Where, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Put it back at the charge. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Th yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. There's mm. Mm. Yeah. That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button, the off button, the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen, please charge charge me. You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger. Yeah. So you will never get lost yeah. Yeah. Yeah because everything is programmed inside. So it's it's uh it's all about strategy, y Mm. Mm. Yeah, yeah. With uh two two two parts controller. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. these are probl yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs, you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them. If numbers, they're easy, but if name the channel by by name Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers. You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel. So some people may want to say, I want to see this channel. Yeah. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser. Uh? Well, it's convenient for the user. The uh uh mm. Mm. I I think that I have mm mm I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example, then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel, so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images, so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time, you just use the control button uh, you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel. So Mm. So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way. Oh, okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, I wanna watch this, I wanna watch that. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Well, you you stay a five minutes.
So we come to the third meetings. I have good. Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design. So we will talk about some specific details. This Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting. But if we use battery We will, okay. Three. What's the function of this button. I think it makes the the interface really Graphical user interface. A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures. Yeah. Mm-hmm. We should include speech synthesis in this case, no? Mm-hmm. Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_. Yeah. On T_V_ T_V_ screen. So just you push the button and we will Yeah. If the if No In the case where they need help, in the case where they need help. Yeah. It's just for user customizable, for kids or old people. So So it's the same Can be used by both kids and old people. Maybe for kids, kids they like uh t no l they like to Yeah. Mm-hmm. You can use this screen instead of the big se screen, instead of use the yeah. Hmm. But Yeah. Mm. It's for it's just for small vocabulary. We it's not yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Push push. It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important. But they are just less used compar yeah. Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others. So. Mm. It's And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_. I You will listen to a peep, special peep. Okay. Yeah. But you don't you don't have to move the the charger. You have to keep it. Okay. Maybe for some people lazy people. Yeah yeah. Mm. Or Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically. So if he. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah it's yeah. Mm-hmm. Or just It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel. Because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary. Or maybe Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary, just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary. Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel. No. Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself. By associating each channel with the name or And for each one has his own. Or you have to s Yeah. Mm. Or we can switch on or switch off the the special, yeah. Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting. It's time to close this meeting. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for your collaborations.
@highlight
So Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design .
@highlight
So we will talk about some specific details .
@highlight
Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote .
@highlight
So uh it's a point to discuss .
@highlight
Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .
@highlight
And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips .
@highlight
So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment .
@highlight
For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons What is this single curved Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .
@highlight
You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .
@highlight
And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?
@highlight
Yeah the um that's the point .
@highlight
The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .
@highlight
But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .
@highlight
We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market .
@highlight
So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .
@highlight
So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .
@highlight
'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever .
@highlight
There's another point I want to make , is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .
@highlight
a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data .
@highlight
we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here .
@highlight
The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .
@highlight
A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .
@highlight
So the here are some examples .
@highlight
So they cluster the buttons together .
@highlight
They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well .
@highlight
but this interface are kind of confusing .
@highlight
Uh basically there are too many buttons .
@highlight
So some people are propose voice recognition ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you .
@highlight
And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .
@highlight
Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , Touch screen , I mean .
@highlight
And some people propose a scroll button .
@highlight
Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button .
@highlight
so there are a few aspects that I collected here .
@highlight
So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , basically they are programmable , And then they also secure uh covers , to protect But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features .
@highlight
I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people .
@highlight
And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .
@highlight
Mm maybe useful for children , And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside .
@highlight
So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .
@highlight
this is another company that provides big buttons .
@highlight
I see that that is useful for old people But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .
@highlight
We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?
@highlight
but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .
@highlight
And uh , this is another one the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume .
@highlight
So there's a up arrow and a down arrow .
@highlight
But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top so it's confusing interface , And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found .
@highlight
Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .
@highlight
And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key .
@highlight
we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .
@highlight
Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .
@highlight
Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help Yeah .
@highlight
That's a good idea .
@highlight
So you are display on the screen .
@highlight
On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .
@highlight
So that eliminates all the complicated documentation , But people are often enough looking at the help , In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .
@highlight
And let us see what the market demands .
@highlight
It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .
@highlight
I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids Can be used by both kids and old people .
@highlight
Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes .
@highlight
And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires .
@highlight
So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .
@highlight
And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy .
@highlight
And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
@highlight
And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .
@highlight
And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .
@highlight
And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls .
@highlight
fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .
@highlight
fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .
@highlight
So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them .
@highlight
We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .
@highlight
Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .
@highlight
yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .
@highlight
So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it .
@highlight
It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .
@highlight
Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .
@highlight
so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers .
@highlight
And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .
@highlight
And also the cost for the speech recognition .
@highlight
Ask our R_ and D_ department .
@highlight
Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so .
@highlight
And also the scroller button , how much will it cost .
@highlight
Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .
@highlight
from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .
@highlight
Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button .
@highlight
Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .
@highlight
Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .
@highlight
But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .
@highlight
Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television .
@highlight
Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .
@highlight
And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ .
@highlight
I because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more I think that there's no contradiction here , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , And the third problem was to find the remote control .
@highlight
But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen But they are just less used compar It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .
@highlight
and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find You will listen to a peep , special peep .
@highlight
that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .
@highlight
uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .
@highlight
so we have some one charger there And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .
@highlight
And that's a good idea , I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command .
@highlight
I mean charger would be fixed what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me .
@highlight
because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger .
@highlight
You never get it lost And of course the final point is a fancy look .
@highlight
As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .
@highlight
But you can have an button for child lock .
@highlight
I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him .
@highlight
So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .
@highlight
Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .
@highlight
I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included .
@highlight
because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them .
@highlight
and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now we have a problem there .
@highlight
You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five .
@highlight
Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so .
@highlight
So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .
@highlight
But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .
@highlight
That will be too big .
@highlight
And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .
@highlight
Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .
@highlight
It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .
@highlight
but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .
@highlight
Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .
@highlight
Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .
@highlight
Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .
@highlight
if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company .
@highlight
So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah .
@highlight
well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .
@highlight
Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .
@highlight
I think these are the practical problems .
@highlight
So we need to take care of them in the design .
@highlight
It's time to close this meeting .","```

IS1005c.json,"Hello, uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control. Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be, but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision. So, uh we will have again three presentation, from all of you, and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions. So, who wants to start? Okay. So start, uh Uh. This one? Turn. Hmm. Okay. Like a sponge. Yeah. Yeah, uh yeah. Easy to use, is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing. It's less important, right? Yeah yeah. Okay. So, Hamed, can you. Mm-hmm. Um. Number? Three. This one? So it's not this one. Okay. Yeah. This one, yeah. Oh,. Oops. Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing, or is there any problem for that? For example, put electronic card on a spongy thing, I can I can imagine it could be a problem. Yep. Okay. So Okay. Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around. maybe after. Yeah. No, I don't think it's seven by seven, I think it's seven the diagonal is seven. Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal. Yeah. I dunno I dun I dun One each. But, yeah,. Let's go. So let's cut the T_F_T_. Mm. These technical engineers, huh. What user wants. He wants a small remote control, or? Uh uh with big buttons. It's difficult. A sm So maybe you can finish your presentation, and afterwards we will discuss about all this. That's it. Okay. So. No. Uh, so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today, so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions. Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries, for example, or something like that. Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery, and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device? Okay. So Okay. Uh like but using how many batteries, for example? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery Okay. Uh one two Okay. The television lights. At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_. I dunno. Okay. Mm. At least it's new and maybe technology New technology. Yeah. Um. So I think before talking about the other thing, it's important thing it's the case. Uh what what are gonna be the size, because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on. For example for the for the L_C_D_, if we choose to have a small device, we cannot use this um a such a a a screen. Oh. I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_, if it's possible. Okay. So we are agree with a small L_C_D_. Yeah. Tactile or something, yeah. Touch screen, yeah. Yeah. The problem is we have a limit in a month of time, so we cannot do something very new. So let's go for a small L_C_D_. Yeah okay. So, five by s ten. Um so what about, so the case we talked about. Um something easy to use, you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way, like with fruit and vegetable, and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on, now, can we do that? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow, and the it should be easy to take in a hand, I thought about banana, or something like that, which is fruits, and A big banana. Um. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just an idea. I dunno what you think about, but Yeah. I dunno if it can fit with the technology. You are the specialists of that. So Yeah, and The screen has to be square? Or it can be like a a shape, quite, uh with curves. It could. Yeah. Okay okay. Yeah. Yeah, it should remember banana, but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana. So we are agree with the banana thing? Okay. So, the last point we decided it's infra-red, I guess. Everybody's agreed. Uh, so that's it I think about the concepts. You have other thing to add to this point, or uh no? So, uh about the user interface, so we are going to use L_C_D_. In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons. I don't know what we are going to do with that. You talked about the buttons on the side Mm what? Yeah. Okay. And you mean the first layer would be spongy. So Is it is it possible to do that? It would be a great idea, but is it possible technically? Like doing a spongy layer of the banana, and you open it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but do you see that as a rigid thing, or like like a banana, something very soft, you can open like banana, or. Yeah. So, I dunno what you think, Bob, but it would be great for users I think, and very good for marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Um. And setting buttons hidden in. Mm, other remarks, or something, or. Something we didn't talk about yes yet, or. I think we are almost there. Uh maybe, how can we, if we have a soft thing, like this, and to open it we have to attach it somewhere, I dunno how to do that technically, or. And how Yeah, maybe. Ma magnetic oh. Okay. Okay. And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean? Mm. Likes. Soft plastic, or Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm. And something we forgot, maybe, uh about the speech recognition system, are we going to use it, or not? It i Yeah, it seems feasible, and it would be something very great. So we have the de design, the a good shape, new and so on, and we have also the technology thing w will be. And even the easy to use thing, so it will be perfect. So we add also the speech recognition device. So, that great. We have decided everything. And think we are on a good way. So, um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes. Um, so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design. The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device. And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation. So, I hope you can do that in thirty minutes. And uh, yeah, I uh I think you should work together, s you uh Hamed and Peter, to work uh in a in a first prototype, and uh more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together. And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on. So thank you all everybody, and see you in thirty minutes.
Hello. Okay. Okay, I'll start. Can you open my presentation, please. I'm number four. Trend. Yep. Can you pass the mouse, please. Oh okay, that's fine. Okay. Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world. Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan. Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel, um as opposed to a functional look and feel, is our number one priority. Um fancy is is is is the, you know, highest priority. Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative. Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria. Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well, but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control. From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan, um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes, shoes and furniture. So, I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category. And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy. Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way. Uh sort of um squishy. Um. Yeah soft, like a uh like a sponge. I don't know. Yeah. Um so in conclusion, we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy, um has lots of technolog tech technology in it. Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel. And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company. Um. That's it. Less important. So um fanciness first and then two ti you know, half as important as that is technology technology, and half important as technology is easy to use. So. Inch. So So Ca Can I ask a question. This seven inch T_F_T_ screen, how big is it in reality? So like that. That's quite big. Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen? But I mean even even that is like this big. Yeah. You can cut the T_F_T_ screen. Okay, so Okay. So, what's the size of the device? Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Is it Can you hold that, or? Yeah, a small c control that they can hold in hand. But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold? Okay. So if we use s solar cells, um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside? Okay. Okay. It's it's quite innovative, yes. And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful. Which is the same area. Could you re could you redesign your board? Oh, five five centimetres by ten centimetres. Yeah. Mm, touch screen. So Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice, with the colour of our company. I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow? Well I'd like a shaped screen. I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen. Yeah, banana's good. Okay. I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that, you know, to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and I think for sure. Definitely. The softer the better. Yeah. We could use Velcro. Or uh ma maybe a magnetic thing. Yeah, I imagine some sort of vinyl thing. In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel. Maybe. Mm. So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and And a and a banana. Yeah. Okay. I think it's important. I think One of our p priorities is tech technology. And Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Hello. I s No, no, you you can start. Yeah. The second one. Could you please show the presentation number three. Yeah. Three. Yes. Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second. Uh, n n no, it's the first one. The second one. Uh yeah. Okay. Okay. So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use. I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy, but okay, we can discuss about it uh later. Um generally, generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something, in my opinion, uh the first feature is just to be easy to use. So, the more frequent buttons should be larger, they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control. And uh s uh I can conclude like this, that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it. It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control. Okay. So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control, and they should be bigger in size. Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand. It should not be completely like uh a cube. It should be it should have round edge, so uh then it's easier. And maybe uh just like some toys, some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand. And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery, it should not uh consume lots of energy. Okay. And my personal p uh preference is uh, as I said, uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button, like mobile phone. Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part, so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels, and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control. And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this. Uh. And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier. Not on remote control. I dunno if I can explain well. But uh just inside. For example, a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff, if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb. So it can be another uh preference. And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good. I know that it consumes lots of energy, but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy. And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new. So it may not be very useful but because it's new, people may buy it. Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something. Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company, or. Okay. That's mine. Mm-hmm. Well maybe it can have two shells, a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside. Yeah yes. Mm. Uh. Yes. Maybe this. So but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. I think I think their being uh large or small is not important. The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily. So let's say an average size, okay, and it should not be very heavy also. And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape, so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner, maybe maybe. So we c it's like like some joysticks. You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape. So the general shape should be like this. I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large. So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion. It's easier. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Or uh or I don't know but I don't want to now invent something new, because we didn't discuss about it. So using some L_C_D_s we can touch, so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh, I dunno the name, L_C_D_ responding to fingers. Touching the screen. Something like Mm like tactile. So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better, because A smaller s Okay. I think this is not good. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah, I think infra-red. Yeah, peeling of the banana. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, some Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface, U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera. If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor. So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this, with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana. So, something like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover, so. Mm-hmm. Yes, yeah it's a good idea. Magnetic. Mm. Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border, so it's it sticks like refrigerator door, completely. And when you try to open it, it will be opened easily. So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes, I think. I think so. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Hmm. What does it mean, spongy? Like soft, or something? Okay. I will see. Okay. I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature. We'll see. Exactly. Uh okay, so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed, but bad news from Bob obviously, because spongy design, I don't like it as Okay, so could you please, Fabien, open it. I'm person two. And which one, uh probably the first one. I'm not sure but check the first one. I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board, but Yeah, that's it. Just It's only this slide? Yeah. This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this, that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just Yeah, seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen, which is good news for us, since we wanted to include a display there. Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme. This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay, so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view. Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape, no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device, but the shape of the inside of the device. So there will be some circuit uh for the power. So, say power circuit here. Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything. I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition, and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells, so. So no problem. There can be also solar cell. Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres, so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design. So at least seven to seven. It depends where you put your screen, because the screen is uh seven inch, so it depends on you where where you put it. It doesn't matter. Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere. So this will be T_F_T_. And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone, which is somewhere, say here. Interface to the microphone. Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_. The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red, including all the stuff inside, so it will be very cheap for us. So infra-red here. So the once again the overall requirements, seven to seven centimetres for the board, which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size, and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches. Um I have to check what I wanted to Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device. A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape, basically. But we have to take care of the T_F_T_. Well, sponginess. Maybe it a good feature, since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good, because it's just keeps it safe, I dunno. Well, it's maybe related to the U_I_. A Yeah, that's all from me. Yeah? Well, seven to seven inches. Yes. Yeah but To be honest, I was Yeah, honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially, but it's seven inches. But I I think we can we can cut it. Yeah, no no problem, because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth. So Yeah, but no problem to to me to cut the screen. So so for the same price we have four screens now. Ah well this is like this is almost nothing. Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something. Yeah, but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that, you know. Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it, at home, you know. I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something. W I I think so. I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that, but just like this, and you know follow follow Well, that's that's no task for me, but well seven to seven at least yeah, but Oh, okay. Okay thanks. Not J uh just a point to the energy th things. If we use the batteries, and the additional so solar cell, then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_, so no problem in energy, I think. But we have to use the solar cell. Otherwise not. Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells. So like three to five centimetres, I dunno exactly, but. S Uh d doesn't need to be sun. It it's just the daylight, you know. Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this, where there is light only when when there are people, but. Yeah from the T_ I don't think it's enough, uh. Ah it's a it's a compromise, no? Yeah, that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition, because you wanted all the new things. Uh the s the screen is okay, but the board, uh that's the problem. Well what what would you guess as a shape? Or what what would be the shape? Mm. Okay. Okay. Five to ten. Well that Yeah, right. Yeah, I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it? We could put the board next to, well, under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand. Like holding something, and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it, you know somehow. Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing, like one unit. Well fi five to ten it would be feasible. Okay, so five to ten, I I think it's it's feasible. I'll make it. Fo Five by ten. Mm-hmm. Okay, so Yeah, so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out. Hmm. Seven to ten banana. Okay. Rather mango or something or. You mean banana. Well, but If it's If it If the banana is big enough. Then, yes. But if you want to look at the screen, no. Well Well, it can be whatever you want. But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just. But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches, so. It's like more more expensive to have shape like that. But I don't care. You know, if we fit this requirement. Okay Yeah, m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one. But Like modified banana, okay. Well it we'll stick to banana, or? Okay. Mm-mm. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Like like peeling of the banana you s It would be cool, yeah. Peeling of the banana, you know, should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. First layer obviously spo Yeah, w It's it's like silly, but the people will really appreciate it, yeah I think. Well is it possible to make it soft? So I think if it's so then it's cool? Cool. Honestly speaking, I cannot imagine it, so far, but it will be terrible. Mm. Pof. Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that, solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape, we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things. So, if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed, then the material must be able to put the light inside, you know. So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that. It is possible, but, well if it I dunno. I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it, or or inside. But then it must be some window there, you know. Yeah. I agree. Okay. Okay.

@highlight
Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?
@highlight
how big is it in reality ?
@highlight
Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .
@highlight
But I I think we can we can cut it .
@highlight
So so for the same price we have four screens now .
@highlight
Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .
@highlight
Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .
@highlight
I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .
@highlight
so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .
@highlight
Uh first I think energy it's a key problem If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think .
@highlight
So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?
@highlight
I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large .
@highlight
Could you re could you redesign your board ?
@highlight
I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .
@highlight
Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible .
@highlight
So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers .
@highlight
So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .
@highlight
My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .
@highlight
I dunno if it can fit with the technology .
@highlight
The screen has to be square ?
@highlight
But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .
@highlight
So we are agree with the banana thing ?
@highlight
It's like more more expensive to have shape like that .
@highlight
I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .
@highlight
So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess .
@highlight
should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .
@highlight
Yeah , peeling of the banana .
@highlight
Is it is it possible to do that ?
@highlight
I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , If you see it's like peeling .
@highlight
You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor .
@highlight
it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .
@highlight
And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
Likes .
@highlight
Soft plastic , or So we add also the speech recognition device .
@highlight
Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design .
@highlight
The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device .
@highlight
And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .
@highlight
uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype ,","```

Shift. No it's not. Yeah, it's not working. Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa? Yeah. Yeah, we Yeah. Yeah, these are new ideas, like glow-in-the-dark or something like that. We discussed all the new ideas, but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals, we couldn't use these, but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this. These are new ideas we And new shapes, everything. At le Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. So So Uh Brian, have you have you finished? Uh mine needs also this. At last mine is also the presentation. Yeah, yeah. S Uh is the project evaluated, that is mine. Yeah. So. Yeah. So. So now is the final evaluation, final evaluation of the uh uh of our product. How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not. How mu What rating we will give to these products. So of course this is will be a team work, w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything. So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this. We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements, whether it meets the user requirements or not, this product. Then trends, whether it is as fashion trends or not? Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays. So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also. Then marketing strategy of the company. As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market, not only in terms of providing quality products, not only in pro providing latest technologies, but also in terms of providing environmental s Yeah. So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products, uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues. So Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale. I'm having this scale this scale, so we have to do it on a board. the user requirem I think. Thank you. So. So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product. First of all uh comes user requirement. So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not. I I will first I would like to have your views, what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not? S So what do you think you will personally give. Seven. Uh. Uh one is means highest ranking, okay. But I think highest ranking is seven, or one? Okay, right right. So it's one for from your point of view. And what do you say our Industrial Expert? Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design, because she was our i Interface Expert. But you can give your views based on technology, whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not? Two. And what about uh you, Brian? You will go for one. Okay. Uh for me personally it is everything fine, it may be having good design, it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise, price-wise, but there is one thing which limits the customers, like we are having only two, three designs, like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange, and Uh yeah, lower end. And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look. But if a person doesn't like banana, or orange, you are limiting him. No, don't buy our product, because we are l we like this only. So we are showing our preference for particular fruits, two or three kinds rather, and Yeah. So. Uh no, uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that, because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products, a range of shapes, like if we see, look at the smallest thing, toffee chocolates, they give a variety of different things. Some children like to buy banana shape, some apple shape, some even pineapple shape, some orange shape. So you can what shape a person will like. So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers. And by limiting them, we are limiting our sales, limiting our profit also. Uh maybe. Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three. So we can Yeah, on an average we can think three, four sevenths, maybe. Three or four? Uh, no sorry, it should be No sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, we are doing a very wrong thing. Yeah, yeah, we are taking everything, and that's I have taken it very wrongly. Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly. So we can say one or two. because it is one point eight uh two, so we will do two. Yeah. So where were the trends. Sorry? Yeah, again the the fashion trends, this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something. Uh. Okay. Yeah. Uh Okay. Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends, these products are quite good, like, these products are in fruit shape, because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised, like clothes, shoes, and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables, or getting them or showing some association with them. So and in this way our product is good. And the second thing, now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy. So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market. And yes. It is cus spongy also. So they can play with it, it's quite good. So then I think, maybe I can give it two. So four five ten thirteen thirteen. So we can Is it fine? So what about company strategy? Okay. So what about you, Brian? Yeah, and me also, like, this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement, as per latest technology, and it should be environmental safe. So since our product meets all these requirements, so I would also prefer to give it rank one. So four six six half. So we can say two or one Okay. So th seven seven. Uh overall we are getting two something, but we can round it as two. Yeah. So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good. So we can launch it. Yeah. So yeah. Great.
Okay. We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint, I guess. How was that, was that fun? Okay. Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes, but I will do. Upsidaisy. Um Um we Yeah. Alright, okay, yeah. He's gonna get his pen. Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news? Uh we have budget problems. I'm afraid you're all sacked. Oops. I don't even have this on. Okay, have you got a presentation to make? No. Okay so it's just your your show. Three? Oh. Tomato? What tomato? I don't recall a tomato. Ah I see, okay. Mm-hmm. Logo. Okay, brilliant. Okay. Okay, so the buttons would be like, you know individual users, or Yeah. Alright, okay. Right. That's groovy. Well I like the feel of it, I like the feel of it. At Oh dear. Alright, okay. Okay, brilliant mm. Okay, nice and obvious there, if it's standing up, I guess, yeah. Oh right, okay, brilliant. Like that from its centre. Where you're, yeah, uh were you're holding it kind of Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, scale model, yeah. Mm-hmm. Alright, excellent. Okay. No. It's out of the way as well, I suppose, so. Excellent. Yep. Okay, so so Barney the banana. Ah excellent, just what we need. Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana. Cool yeah. Well, nice to have uh options at least. 'Kay and Oh there are issues, oh there are issues. Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance. Uh, let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria. Um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons, uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros. So we have to rea Sorry, I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um. There we go. Oh god, why is it doing that? There we go. So basically, um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape, but just have it flattened. Um. Yeah, I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape, so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out. And by doing so Oh no, hold on. Doesn't save us quite as much. I don't know what's going on with this again. Oh, good point. Um. That's sort of curve in and out. No, I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half, and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward. Okay, I might be wrong though. I don't think that counts as a curve, I think that's just a shape. A curvature is like the this case. Yeah, and why why I've got it two, I don't know, I can't seem to select any more however. Right. No. It's meant to be one, yeah, I don't know why I put two in there, but um Hold on till I find it, I think this shift button might be stuck again. No maybe the shift button's stuck in. Um okay, so that would take away three, which would give us Oh that's fine. Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty. Um We cou Oh not quite, have the scroll-wheel, unfortunately. What? Yeah. Yeah, I know, that just extends it as well. I don't know. It One of the buttons is sticking, I don't know. No, it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck, or something. No that's fine. Um we've worked out what it would be anyway. Yeah. Cancel. Piss off. Oh well, never mind. Um. Right, so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add? Um Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got. So Yeah. Yeah yeah. Well that's that's uh Okay, so project evaluation. We have under twelve Euros fifty. Project process, how do we think that went? Are we happy? Okay. Evaluation. Oh we've been writing this up for m months. Uh room for creativity, were we happy with that? No, I mea I think it means sort of individually. Yes, no, maybe? Okay. Groovy. So uh we're just gonna. Uh yeah, okay. Teamwork? Leadership, sorry. Thank you very much. You're all get you're all getting a raise. Uh teamwork. I thought went well. Yeah. Uh and well means, yeah. The technical stuff was brilliant. Let's buy more. Uh Right. Um I don't know what, new ideas found, means, to be honest. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Groovy. So just general thumbs up for all of us then. That kind of unfortunately is too quick. Uh. I suppose yeah. Um. That's it, um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you. Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work. Whoops. Does it go back in, does it? Reusable. I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying. Uh-huh. Um I have, yes. Huh? Oh right, okay, you've got more, okay. Sorry uh. It didn't bother to tell me that on this thing. Is it? Okay. Doesn't tell me. Oh you're doing that. We evaluated ourselves, we thought we were great. Mm. O okay, hold on. I wonder w which cell do I want. Okay, I didn't realise you had that bit. Okay. Okay. Alright, okay. The board working again, is it? Uh. Yeah. When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_, so yeah, of course we haven't actually got a working model yet. One, yeah. No it's it's like true is one end, and false is the oth Oh, I'll go for a one. Basic requirements but of the pro of the project. Yeah th Come on that was the tha 'Kay. Being fruitist. He's a tough cookie. Six. Five or six. Oh I see. Yeah, I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in, I mean uh it might it might be trendy to some, but I'm just not swallowing the fruit, so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it. Um so yeah I'd say about four as well. Yeah, yeah. Um yeah, a three. Pretty much kept to the company strategy, so I would go for a a one, as we not only kept it, but we were limited by Cool, groovy. Cool. Brilliant. In which case we are done. 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget. Champagne lunch anyone?
Okay. Mm. Very fun. Oh right. Okay. Mm. Okay. Sure. We made three for you. Um one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato and the other one is st Look. Oh yeah, well yeah, we had v some red left over. So. Okay, so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one, or as mm few buttons as possible, mainly speak recognition. The yellow there is the um the slogan, yeah, that we need to incorporate, it's very simple. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there, um but mainly it's speech recognition. Yeah. Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there. Mm I'm not sure about that. Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier. Yeah, you guys can have a look at that if you want. Yeah, sure. Um that one is Oh no, it's delicate. That's that's already got its stand that one. That's it stand. It does also lie flat, but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand. Um the black on the back is the slogan. Uh yeah, that Well, we did think of that. Yeah, if it's standing up it's it's on there, but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle. So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing. These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. We n were weren't sure about putting them there, because um i it's it kind of could get bashed. Yeah. Well, if you hold it, you can you all can hold it, is it does actually feel quite ergonomic, if you've got small hands. Um, obviously I don't think that's real sized. It would have to be a bit bigger. Okay. Um that's a speaker at the top, so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition. Um and um then the buttons. Yeah kind of self-explanatory, just buttons whenever you need them. Tried to keep it simple. Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom. We used those. And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one. It's not in the traditional place, but um it's quite an obvious place. So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So are there any um improvements or issues or Oh. Oh. Ooh. Mm-hmm. More like a traditional remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like an S_ shape. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Cool. Cool. So we could even add something. Well maybe we could add something, but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money, so. Yeah, if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money, if we don't have to. But if there is anything you think we've missed out there, then, you know, feel free to add it. Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front, because it's not in an ideal place right now. Mm. I think it went quite smoothly. W I think we were very creative. Oh right, okay. Mm-hmm. Excellent leadership. Yeah, everyone got enough input, I think. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Well um. Mm. Yeah, maybe. Oh, you got a presentation, sorry. Yeah. Mm, love to eat that now. Kind of a green banana now. It's this as well, sorry, we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex, new material that we've got. I've got. Yeah. Oh could you pass the tomato please. Sorry. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sorry. Sorry, carry on. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um. Mm-hmm. Um I think Yeah, it did. It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted. Um so. Does it work? Yeah. So. I would say seven. Seven is good, yeah, isn't it? I can't True or false? No sorry tr one is true. Yeah. Okay, so one. Yep. Mm yellow. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Is that no is that not trends? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. But in electronics, I think, it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates. I think, you know, if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from, a company'll have two or three choices, but they're different designs. We were coming up with one product. No, I mean uh obviously your opinion, I'm just trying to Okay. What are we doing? Adding them up? Oh. Okay. Okay, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well um going on uh the specifications that we had, that fruit and vegetables are quite popular, and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons, I would give it um, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that that looks cool, you know, so I would actually give it a three. Tha three or four, I'm not sure. Three. Go for three. That's fine. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um. Yeah, the company strategy, okay. Um there was lot of discussing, that was good. Um I feel I got my say. Um so I'd give the company strategy a two. Okay. Is it? Okay. Okay, so one or two. One. Okay, just leave it, it's fine. Mm. Yeah, one. Okay. Woo-hoo. Cool. Yeah.
Okay, almost there. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, there's good news? Oh. Oh. Cutbacks. Hmm. Okay. Oh. Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Oh yeah, yeah. This one is uh, I suppose for the younger audiences. A a more friendly type of Right, right. It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or Yeah. Say it for the camera. Right, right. Yep. It won't stand. Just let it lie down, it wont stand. What's on the uh on the left? Okay. W why is the uh double curved two of them? Is i Mm. 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there, right. got two of them Okay. Well we can work around that um Cut things out. But you think it should be one. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so we're We should fire the accountants. Fire the accountants. Ah yeah, we could add things. Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell, where you're starting from, and then use the arrow keys. Does that work? No mm. Is it the other shift button maybe? Did you try both shift buttons? It could be the other side. That's too bad. Oh. Yeah I think we have a a winning product. Great leadership. Yeah, yeah. These pens are are neat though. Okay. Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this, right. Right, right. Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay. Something we should get. Oh ok Uh. Anybody Clay covered banana. blue. It's fun to touch. Do we have the uh the marker for the board? There it is. No that's false. Uh. It's hard to know. I I give it a two. Okay. Um yeah, I think i it might even exceed it um. But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons. Um I'm gonna give it a two. Two. What are we doing? We're gonna average them? Okay. So seven fourths. About one point f one point eight. Okay. Yeah round it up to two. So trends. Can you explain what you want us to write there? How it how conforms to the current trends? 'Kay. As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology, but it's missing the screen, as we said, um but it does have the push-buttons, or the scroll-buttons, um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism. So I give it a a four. I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology. Yeah. Well it was yellow. Well, I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy. Is that the question? Um. Yeah. I'll go with two. So one and a half. A two. Yep. S Okay. Uh.
@highlight
Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do .
@highlight
Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ?
@highlight
Okay , have you got a presentation to make ?
@highlight
No , not mine yet .
@highlight
We made three for you .
@highlight
Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition .
@highlight
If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .

and and um we have the banana-based one too .
@highlight
This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .
@highlight
Well , nice to have uh options at least .

So are there any um improvements or issues or Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
@highlight
Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria .
@highlight
the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .
@highlight
So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .
@highlight
Doesn't save us quite as much .
@highlight
W why is the uh double curved two of them ?
@highlight
Oh , good point .
@highlight
I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .
@highlight
and why why I've got it two , I don't know , But you think it should be one .
@highlight
Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .
@highlight
So we could even add something .
@highlight
Ah yeah , we could add things .
@highlight
Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to .
@highlight
Project process , how do we think that went ?
@highlight
Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
@highlight
Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?
@highlight
W I think we were very creative .
@highlight
Leadership , Great leadership .
@highlight
Uh teamwork .
@highlight
I thought went well .
@highlight
Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think .
@highlight
These pens are are neat though .
@highlight
Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that .
@highlight
So just general thumbs up for all of us then .
@highlight
Uh Brian , have you have you finished ?
@highlight
At last mine is also the presentation .
@highlight
Oh , you got a presentation , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got .
@highlight
So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product .
@highlight
whether it meets our standards or not .
@highlight
w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything .
@highlight
We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .
@highlight
Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ?
@highlight
Then marketing strategy of the company .
@highlight
Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale .
@highlight
what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?
@highlight
It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted .
@highlight
Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ?
@highlight
True or false ?
@highlight
Uh one is means highest ranking , So it's one for from your point of view .
@highlight
I'm gonna give it a two .
@highlight
Oh , I'll go for a one .
@highlight
Uh for me personally it is everything fine , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .
@highlight
So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , Is that no is that not trends ?
@highlight
because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .
@highlight
we are doing a very wrong thing .
@highlight
We're gonna average them ?
@highlight
About one point f one point eight .
@highlight
I have taken it very wrongly .
@highlight
Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , so I would actually give it a three .
@highlight
'Kay .
@highlight
As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism .
@highlight
it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , It is cus spongy also .
@highlight
Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , So what about company strategy ?
@highlight
Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .
@highlight
Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by Uh overall we are getting two something , So we can launch it .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight

ES2007b.json,"Think we can first. Right. I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again. just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know. So Okay, and Gabriel. E_L_ is it? 'Kay. And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ Okay. 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think. Uh, right. Okay, right, welcome to meeting B_. Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting, basically, uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now. I am your Project Manager, and, uh yeah, I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going, get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically. Um right, this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you, what you've been working on for the last wee while, when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and, you know, filling out silly questionnaires and things. But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive. So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation. Um. Then we're gonna work, you know, from each of your presentations. We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all. Um and then we'll, yeah, we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it. This meeting it's not very long. It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now. So I want each of your presentations to not be too long, five five minutes, something like that. Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy, it doesn't matter, it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium. If you haven't had time to prepare one, you can draw stuff on the noteboard, you can talk to us, you can you know however you want to do your little presentation, basically, you can. Don't feel pressurised into using this thing. 'Cause I don't. Uh okay. So um. You okay over there? Reissa, are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there? Okay, jolly good. Alright, let's have um well, we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with. I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be. So that's gonna be you Catherine, if we wanna hear from you first. You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go. Ah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Great. Okay. I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally. Yeah. Do you wanna just give us a moment, I just wanna copy this down. Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this? Yeah, you blow on it and i Yeah, it's worked for the last fifty years you know. How far away is your television? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, does it? Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall. Yeah, yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things. You know we don't need it. Yeah, exactly. Basically, we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit. We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff. It's uh Okay. Right, well done, Catherine. Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Great. Okay. Now that's I just have a q a q question for you. This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other, you know, existing units stuff. Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or Yeah. Yeah. Um I would say it's If it's simple to do, which I think it probably should be, even if it's a physical, you know, a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote, even something like that, um then yes, it's like, you know, like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing, something like that, but you know being physical. Look into. Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well, something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_. You know, the the company it's it's, from what I can see from our other products, are yellow with blue writing on them. Um. We put the fashion in electronics. There you go. So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable. If if remote control well, if telephones can be fashionable, then maybe remote control units can be. Yeah. Because we need Yeah. Great. Okay, fantastic. Right, well done, Gabriel. Um Reissa. Let's plug you in, baby. Yeah, w it it just takes a wee while. 'Cause we've only got five channels. I think that's k flicking quickly between channels. Yeah. Wow. You are a child of technology, aren't you? So there you go, yeah. Uh but do the younger generation have the money? They they don't. It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there. For people up to the age of thirty five, you're kinda saying, yeah, they want it. Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years. Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there, so yeah, it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent. Yeah. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off. So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this. Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time, say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury. Yeah. They're having a lunch break at the moment, but yeah. I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting. Yeah. Okay. That's great, thank you very much for that, Reissa. Um okay, so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be, you know uh, we're going for a basic television remote. It's gotta be safe to use, it's gotta look cool. It's gotta be cheap. S um. Now going back to the uh industrial design of it, you know, we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth. I think, we should just go with the simplest option on everything, uh and that would be infra-red, energy source, that would be batteries. Uh mean we we can look into using the s, you know, the little tiny weeny batteries, all like special long-lasting batteries. Um. But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years, because technology will have changed and, you know, we won't have televisions in ten years' time. So I think we're all um pretty sussed on that. Um anyone have any questions? Everybody happy in their work? Now this is good, we've got a good structure going on. We all know where we're going to. Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers? Yeah. Yeah, stuff. Um okay. Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other? Right. Do all you all know my e-mail address? Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses?. Send me, yeah yeah, okay. Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, but I might be just going a bit Okay. Well, maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas? Well, see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image. It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product. There's loads of companies that called R_R_. This is slog but this is the slogan, this is the the the the type. Yeah. Well, not necessarily. But we have to incorporate it. Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a, you know, a Panasonic product. It's got to so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein, perhaps. Yeah. Yeah. Quite poss yeah. Well this is all your department. Mm okay. Well, well done everybody. And um, I think we uh stop for lunch now. We might possibly have done. If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish, then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch. Yeah, there you go. Right. I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down, but Take your headsets off, kick back, smoke 'em if you got 'em.
Right it was function F_ eight or something. This one right there. Okay. Think we all Huh. Oh I thought we all were. Yeah, I have one too, okay. S Whoops I forgot to put the thing on Okay. Yeah. Sure, that's a good idea. Uh Gabriel. E_L_. Think she's finishing up her presentation. Oh. Yeah, alternate energy source, like win wind power or Bicycle power. One question I have, and I don't know how much control we have over this is um, as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, you know, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the the T_V_, and still have it be operational? I mean, maybe we want one with a strong signal stream. Uh That's true. Okay. Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh. Technical. Okay. Okay, so, while this is warming up, there it is uh. So I'm doing the user interface design. Yeah, and basically uh, as far as methods, I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there. Thinking of what we can retain, what we can do away with, uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um. we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change, I guess, I mean people want a remote that's familiar, that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics, but Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that, the basic functionality that people want. Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control, um so up-down keys for that, uh channel keys up-down, but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want, rather than doing up-down, and uh a mute button. Uh one thing that I didn't include here, that I forgot that we talked about last time, was doing um some sort of lock uh function. Uh, I don't I dunno, uh that's one possibility. And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes, ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred, which I don't know if I can access the web page from here, but I can show you uh. Yeah. So this is a engineer centred one, so you see it's rather busy, but it also lets you play your movie, stop your movie, fast-forward, all this, um freeze frame. Uh and this is a user centred one. Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do, you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes. And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, uh or the direction we were going in at least. Um. So, the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality, but it can be a little bit overwhelming, so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use. Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh, Reissa, because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this. So uh, yeah, that's me. No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know. I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones. That was sort of the inspiration for it. Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business. I've, haven't I've never seen a locking functionality. I dunno, what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? Yeah. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Right. Mm. Right. And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics. I think I think we have to carry that mental. Mm. Well yeah these, I think, we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design. I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here, I mean. Uh, everything is going t ergonomic, you know, there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market, I guess. Um.. Yeah. Uh, yeah, this is getting all. Mm. Yeah, then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up. Yeah, it just takes a second uh. Yeah, you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess. Mm. No I would I would say the older the older people, yeah. Yeah, that would be my guess as well. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit. I mean, okay, there's Uh. Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing Mm. Mm. Yeah, we should probably consult with our legal department uh. Yeah. I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements. Mm. Yeah, it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page. Oh it's probably just you, 'cause you're the project manager. Sell trying to sell your things. Okay. No I don't. I Uh Oh, it's just participant one oh okay. Yeah. Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one, participant two. So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that. Well, it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders. Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups, so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable.. Yeah, pretty soon I think, I guess that's now. Alright, see you all soon.
. I am Reissa. R_E_I_S_S_A_. Double S_ A_, yeah yeah. Sorry. Mm 'kay. Mm. I'm fine. Yeah. I uh yeah, yeah. D I mean, I I'm finishing off my presentation. No no. Uh I'm done. Okay. Mm. Is a battery like the only way of No, no No I meant like No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying. The battery's down and maybe, I dunno, solar charged? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down, and go into the other room. How about Bluetooth? Instead of using infra-red, use Bluetooth. Isn't that a better signal? Mm. Mm. 'S just an idea. Adjusting. Yeah. Mm.. Mm. Mm. Mm. Okay.. Where does it go into? Here? The blue thing.. Well, function F_ eight. No oh. Come on. Right. Okay.. Okay. Well, for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab, and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out. Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know, so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings. So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly. Okay, so they don't like the look of the remote control. Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy. So I think we all agree with that. Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user. So, they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave. Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote, so probably if you have like one, two, three, four, five, the whole up to z ten, they probably don't use those, they only use the up and down channel. exactly. That's another thing. Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap. Not quite sure what they mean, zap, goes like. Yeah. Mm. Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote. I think especially for uh the older generation. I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones, takes ages to work how to use. Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room, so nobody can find them. So maybe tracking devices is a good idea. Um personal preferences. Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people. Um has to look really cool, flashy groovy for people to buy it. And it's easy to find, so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating. So voice activation. So and this was what we came up with. Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age, sorry, age groups. So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes. Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one. And neither did the older generation, but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote. Well the twenty five to thirty five year old, and thirty five, and the thirty five to forty five, forty five point seven per cent say no, so So they don't Well These guys are growing up. Voice activation might not be the best. Um also with um with buttons, a thing called R_S_I_, so wrist sense Huh? Yeah, repetitive strains injury, so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often, keep changing channel hurts their wrist. I don't think so. Yeah maybe not so hard. Yeah. Maybe Mm. Yeah. Mm. Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much, or we just like flat buttons, something. Yeah. So that is me. Mm. Mm. Mm. Well, just questionnaires. Yeah, you can. I think he's participant one, aren't you? Can't we have different colours in the remotes, so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain? But if it's a R_R_, it would be Real Reaction, like if it had a symbol on it. Whoa. So we have to have it one colour. Mm. Mm. Mm. Are we are we finished ahead of schedule? 'Kay uh.
Mm. Tha Okay. Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation? You will as well? Okay. Yep. Okay I'm Okay. I'm Catherine with a C_. C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_. Right. True. How long is the meeting? Okay. No problem. Okay. Okay. Um just connecting this. Are we getting i Really? Okay. Cool. Okay. So I've got a very quick uh Uh. Okay. So the working design, I've got a very quick presentation on this, so um I've oh no, you can't see a thing. Oh well, I'm gonna draw it on the board then. It's in blue uh, and I couldn't change it. We it's fine on my screen, but never mind. So um the idea is that we've got the energy source um, which in our case will pr, oh well okay, never mind. So um I think maybe uh two batteries, I dunno what they're called six, or something like that. Uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal, which could be uh an infra-red signal, um which will be sent by an electronic chip. And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface. So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel. And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels. Um and that's it really for the working design. Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but Really? Cool. Um, should I erase this or Okay. Fine. Or suggestions? Well, it's just, you don't want it plugged in really, s In indoors. I dunno, swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain, but Yeah. Well, the thing is uh you you don't Well, we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it. I didn't think about that but Why not? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it. It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice, but then I don't th I dunno, either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room, you are gonna But Oh, we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage, maybe, I don't Do you need the border? Okay. Sorry. Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then. Maybe it could be, instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep.. Well, in the project announcement, you've got the addresses, I think. So Project Manager, it's participant one at A_M_I_. You have them i you have them, but we'll send you an e-mail. You want to have friends, don't you? It wouldn't be Well you could It could come But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and If. Cool.

so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again .

Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?
@highlight
Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?
@highlight
So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders .
@highlight
Can't we have different colours in the remotes , And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .
@highlight
So we have to have it one colour .
@highlight
Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .
@highlight
but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .
@highlight
But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

ES2002a.json,"Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface. Yeah. Well, my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry, and uh when planet of the apes becomes real, I'm gonna be up there with them. Yeah. I know um My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house. So um for them it was just how many devices control. Uh.
Mm-hmm. Great. And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's that's it. Yeah. I will go. That's fine. Alright. So This one here, right? Okay. Very nice. Alright. My favourite animal is like A beagle. Um charac favourite characteristics of it? Is that right? Uh, right, well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health. So this is blue. Blue beagle. My family's beagle. I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles. Boy, let me tell you. Impressionist. Alright. Mm. Superb sketch, by the way. Yep. I see a dog in there. Yep. Now I see a rooster. What kind is it? Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing? Hmm. Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned. 'Kay. Um, can we just go over that again? Uh, so bas at twel Alright, yeah. Okay. So cost like production cost is twelve fifty, but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? Like on the shelf. Our sale our sale anyway. Yeah, okay okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh, like with D_V_D_ players, if there are zones. Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters, um different uh keypad styles and s symbols. Um. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price. I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different, so Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just Or just like, basic product podi positioning, the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London, might not be such a big hit in Greece, who knows, something like that, yeah. Yep. Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here, thinking, 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic, something other than just standard. Um so I'm wondering right away, is selling twenty five Euros, is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah, I'd say so, yeah. No. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out, I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something. It just comes along. Do you know what I mean? Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be, well the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls. Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something. But Right. Right. Okay so Right, so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses I think so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well like um, maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots. They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, M_P_ three players, telephones, everything, agenda. So, like, I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house, or um Yeah, yeah. An Yeah. Like, p personally for me, at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player. So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know, the sound and everything it's just one system. But each one's got its own little part. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's just really good id Yep. Uh, sure. I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable. Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like, like on a blender or something. And um, you know, when I think about what they are now, it's better, but actually it's still kind of, I dunno, like a massive junky thing on the table. Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined. S Something like that, yeah. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better, but that just the appeal of of not having You know, these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know. Um, nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway. Okay. Um. Before we wrap up, just to make sure we're all on the same page here, um, do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something, right? Well, um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features? I I don't know. Yep. Yeah, sure. Okay. Okay, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright.
Okay. Right. Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project. Um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes. Um so first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other, I'm Laura and I'm the project manager. Do you want to introduce yourself again? Okay. Great. Okay. Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually. So that's David, Andrew and Craig, isn't it? And you all arrived on time. Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control. Um, as you can see it's supposed to be original, trendy and user friendly. Um so that's kind of our our brief, as it were. Um and so there are three different stages to the design. Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails. What did you get? Mm-hmm. Is that what everybody got? Okay. Um. So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there. Um. So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. So who would like to go first? Very good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Lovely. Right. You can take as long over this as you like, because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss. Ok oh we do we do. Don't feel like you're in a rush, anyway. Ach why not We might have to get you up again then. I don't know what mine is. I'm gonna have to think on the spot now. Is that a whale? Ah. Okay. God, I still don't know what I'm gonna write about. Um. I was gonna choose a dog as well. But I'll just draw a different kind of dog. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. Um That doesn't really look like him, actually. He looks more like a pig, actually. Ah well. Do you? Oh that's very good of you. Uh. Um he's a mixture of uh various things. Um and what do I like about him, um That's just to suggest that his tail wags. Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you, and very kind of affectionate and um uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space. Um and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well, which is quite amusing, so It is. I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room. Yeah, so uh Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Right, um where did you find this? Just down here? Yeah. Okay. Um what are we doing next? Uh um. Okay, uh we now need to discuss the project finance. Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro, um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro. Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale. And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price. Sure. All together. Um I dunno. I imagine That's a good question. I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want. Um. But I I don't know, I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Think it will? Um. Hmm. Oh yeah, regions and stuff, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well for a remote control, do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is. Yeah, yeah. Okay. What, just like in terms of like the wealth of the country? Like how much money people have to spend on things like? Aye, I see what you mean, yeah. Marketing. Good marketing thoughts. Oh gosh, I should be writing all this down. Um. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like how much does, you know, a remote control cost. Well twenty five Euro, I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something, isn't it? Or no, is it as much as that? Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds. Um, I dunno, I've never bought a remote control, so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you. Um. But yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky. Um right, okay. Let me just scoot on ahead here. Okay. Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all? Thin No, actually. That would be useful, though, wouldn't it, if you knew like what your money would get you now. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Five minutes to end of meeting. Oh, okay. We're a bit behind. Yeah. Right, so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know, do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or even like, you know, notes about um what you wanna watch. Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea. So extra functionalities. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Um okay, uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes. Um I'll just check we've nothing else. Okay. Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used, what they would really like to be part of this new one at all? You keep losing them. Okay. Yeah. W You get those ones where you can, if you like, whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep. There I mean is that something we'd want to include, do you think? Dunno. Okay maybe. My goodness. Still feels quite primitive. Maybe like a touch screen or something? Okay. Uh-huh, okay. Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer. It looks better. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right, well um so just to wrap up, the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes. So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch. Um so inbetween now and then, um as the industrial designer, you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there. Um for user interface, technical functions, I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about, what it'll actually do. Um and uh marketing executive, you'll be just thinking about what it actually what, you know, what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you, I guess. Um. Yeah, so it's th the functional design stage is next, I guess. And uh and that's the end of the meeting. So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would, so Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, yeah. Th Okay, well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now. Um I guess that's up to us, I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, so um, you know Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Right, okay, we'll that's that's the end of the meeting, then. Um. So, uh thank you all for coming.
Hi, I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer. Um, I just got the project announcement about what the project is. Designing a remote control. That's about it, didn't get anything else. Did you get the same thing? Cool. There's too much gear. Okay. Can't draw. Um. Yeah. Um, well anyway, I don't know, it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head. Um. Yes. Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals. Allergic to animal fur, so um fish was a natural choice. Um, yeah, and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting. Tail's a bit big, I think. It's an after dinner dog then. Hmm. It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages, then you need more buttons. So, possibly. Hmm. Yeah. And you keep losing them. Finding them is really a pain, you know. I mean it's usually quite small, or when you want it right, it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table. You know. Yep. Mm-hmm. I think one factor would be production cost. Because there's a cap there, so um depends on how much you can cram into that price. Um. I think that that's the main factor. Cool.

IS1001b.json,"Hello. Make a start yeah. So. Cable, camera. Should be in my in their folder no? Up. Um at three I think. No? Mm. Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe? It is possible. It was somewhere in something like this. I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something. Go up. Yeah go up. Again. No. Go back. Uh maybe messenger AMI. Messenger. No. There is nothing. Let's go and check. I'll go and check. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So uh. Basically what we want here is a remote control right. So um the question well first of all what to control. So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that. And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house. Yeah, so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that, uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff. So there is one that is one thing. The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever. Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah. So I think it should be a package in that case. Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts. One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part. Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices, a set of buttons for special navigation in space, a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access. Yeah? Like a video tape goes forward, backwards, uh fast and stuff yeah. Um. Mm? Yeah. For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah? Uh. Mm. Yeah and also parameter changing. So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff. Voice command w we could specify anything. We could assign any button a command to any button, if we have enough processing power, I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah I think so. Not so far. Where did you put it? mm. I'm designing the user interface. But what kind of remote controls did you look at? What kind of task was it? It was a T_V_? Huh. Uh-huh. Ah! Good. Other side yeah, yo wa your wrist. It i can become painful you can have tendonditis. Yeah. If you also up on a computer in a strange position. Ergonomic. But uh. Have to say ha ha. Mm-hmm. The first question. Mm. Mm. Mm I it's not true I think. The the second claim that you put. Yeah. I think that should be the same. I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it. I don't think Uh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff. This will think this will take more time to develop also. Yeah. Soon. Yeah. So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition. Yeah. Yeah. Ten years. But we don't have time to market. I think we should contact management. Well. Uh How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no, one hundred thousand units. Eh chips. We're gonna need chips right. Yeah. How much will it cost for one hundred thousand? Okay. So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition. Yeah? Okay. So. No it doesn't. Okay. Four million. Mh-hmm. A a lot of people are uh if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user. So I mean there are markets and markets. I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah. So for our young people uh it will be cool, they can be able to use it. Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it. I guess. I don't know if there is study about that. Mm. And there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else. All right? Otherwise, if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But teletext is just one button. You you just write the write the numbers. So will you add with the channel keys, right? So. I am. I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button. So. Mm-hmm. Capital. Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple. Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control, there is no other function that I can see really. Uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us. Or something. It's a memory, yeah. And uh and of course the channel changing buttons. How should they how should we implement that? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental. Mm-hmm. Mm. It's an interesting idea, that if you press it for a long time it does something else, in general. So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time No. Doesn't work does it. Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands. Change channel to eight. No. Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this. Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. On the lower side I think it you have to turn it. No? If we do that. Yeah. Because of that Because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah? The channels change one by one. So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh whatever, yeah. Yeah. I think it's only put on if cou have multi function. If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_. Just increase the cost. The user does not have an advantage really. Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool. It would. Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. What is the folder that you put yours in? And did it it did work? Ah yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay what is your email? At participant one. Okay. Well during lunch break actually. So next time we should have a fight. How about uh management or something. Who happens to be your friend.
Okay. F do you want to start? Okay. No. What do you have in short cut? Participant two. Yeah. Otherwise, could you just describe by hand? With the the whiteboard? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you mean by linear access then? Ah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm just thinking of some thing. Um We want to have a no, I don't know if this is a good idea. We want to have a a general remote control for everything. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. No no. Finish tonight. But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation, it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so. So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control. If fact Yeah but Do I have oh yeah. Now I have enough cables. Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy. We just have sorry, I'm going Like that. I'm just going to describe. Basically we have a a battery a power supply here. After that we just have um user interface. Let's say that um something like that, which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button, something like that. Push button or a L_C_D_. After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip. So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component. And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy. Yeah. Y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display. And so for us uh this is quite easy. We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television. So for us this is quite easy. Yeah. Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition, in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple Yeah of course of course. And um but for a standard one this is really easy. It's a question of one month and so on s No no no no, I say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that. Yeah. Definitely. I would say. I would say uh about eight months to have the first results. Yeah. I can Um. Yeah. Yeah even. I mean that this is really standard devices now. Um eight. For uh speech recognition. And also how much uh I think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a Yeah but how many yeah. Yeah. Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip. Yeah, we can Mm-hmm. Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta? Is it Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control. Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason? To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want? You say that I want, I have six button Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping. I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look, uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now, you have a button, you you press it, and this is uh the previous channel which has come back. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Let's say that we can do something like that. This is uh incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five. To go fa to go faster. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Or we can do something like that. We can design the remote control to have access. You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y You Yeah, a kind of joystick. Mm-hmm. Or a or a ball, yeah, not a a wheel but a ball, and you say uh to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the yeah. 'S quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel. A blue a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Ten years Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Mm. Yeah. Um I dunno if you can open the uh m is not here. Uh in yeah okay. No. In document. Mm computer yeah. Here. Here. But it's not Um. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Um. It's participant one? Okay. You can uh. Yeah. Okay so you can you can go. Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice, more kind. Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy. Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good. So okay. So it's not in theory but I I can I can say yeah. Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot. So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that. Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks. Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control. So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or Yeah. F not many buttons, and uh and uh uh u useable buttons. Sorry? Yeah. Uh most for most is T_V_. 'Kay you can go so. So there are other frustrations expressed by users, so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it. Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use. And uh remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ um I dunno. Yeah. Uh. Okay um before that I I have some some some thing uh to say before um We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel. Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that. So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and Very accessible yes. That's right. So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions. So you know that um for the younger it's very important to have the s yes and speech recognition. And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh. So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in. Yeah. Mm. Okay and if there is th the conclusion now. So as we say before, I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing. Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before, e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to An I s no, yeah. I dunno if you see something else important or Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm? Yeah. Oh. Would j Uh yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it, it's it's okay. But Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. No. No no. I dunno, I dunno it. 'Kay thank you.
Okay everyone's ready. So we are here for uh for uh functional design. Okay? So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agenda so we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification, technical function design and working design. Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board. Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting. Of the of the process. So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did? You can start. You have uh PowerPoint? Ah yeah maybe there. Okay. Who are you? Ouch. And We have a technical problem uh. You put it on Yeah. You have no Over. Okay. There's no We have a technical problem. If you remember yeah but that's Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay so special navigation, linear access, random access and there's a fourth one no? So the better now for special navigation? Okay. Then linear access then random access. Ah yeah parameter okay. Okay. Okay. Okay and and voice command did you uh Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's uh that close your investigations? Okay. Okay. Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with I dunno if I can open it. Maybe you can s It's Messenger no? In which folder? Short-cut to AMI shared folder? Maybe you can send it to me by email. Just to participant one. At AMI. I will try to show it to everyone, that would be more comfortable. You send it? Yeah. Uh this is this email. Okay. So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask, that will be more convenient. So okay, functional requirements. Mm. Yeah. We can just keep doing that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so fewer buttons maybe would be good? Okay. Yeah. Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following. Okay. Yeah. To find it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What is her other side? Oh yeah? I did not knew that. Okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah. It's your job Oh. Uh sorry got a message from Microsoft. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This function should be very uh accessible. Yeah, okay. This is the main function okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To have L_C_D_ and voice. Okay. Yeah maybe this this is important. Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay these are the user requi Yeah. No no no. We w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control. From the management board I receive an email. Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control. That it would be too long to develop. Oh yeah. Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important. So maybe it's a good decision. I dunno. What's your opinion? Okay. Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I don't know. Okay. Are you okay? U_C_ is the central unit? Okay yeah. Computation. Okay. Okay. Okay so this is quite easy. There is not that much constraints. To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control? Standard button one. So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now? Okay so i it's a bit long yeah. One month for the standard one with button. Even if we have a L_C_D_ display? Okay yeah. Okay so we can take this into account. So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition? Yeah it will. Euros. Yeah, yeah. Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros. Because we are It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting. Okay. Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have. Yeah I I will continue. Well ask your question if you want. Okay. It's not intuitive first. Yeah. But, but also it seems that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product. Yeah. But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons. So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control. Losed lose it etcetera. These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop. So but le let us see first the new requirement. So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff. Yeah. So well Yeah. So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users, they prefer to s Yeah. I dunno. If i one button is still one more button. If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors. Well anyway I have this point. We can discuss. Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market. And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product. So this is the the key point. So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera. So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect, it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point, no? Yeah okay. So yeah the key point here is simple. Maybe. So few buttons, channel, volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that? Yeah. Maybe switch T_V_ on and off Yeah. Yeah. Volume, maybe a mute button, and then on off button. And that's all? Mm. Okay. Yeah this is cool. Maybe we can include that also. Previous previous channel button. So we have like channel button, the previous channel button, the volume button, plus a mute button, and uh just the the traditional on off button. Yeah. I I talk about that, yeah? Yeah. Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them. We go faster? Mm. Maybe we should have also a digit button Yeah. Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental. I dunno bec because if you have the Uh. Yeah. Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one. So I think we need also digits. Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental. Okay. So have a wheel for incremental, have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected, and uh yeah I think this is the basi And do we do we have a No, a wheel is better. I would say the wheel is better. What is the expert of uh Okay. Yeah. That's a good idea. Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control. Okay. Yeah, and do we put an L_C_D_ display? Because it was important for young customers if you remember. Okay. So no L_C_D_? And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process. Yeah. That would be cool. But eight months is really long and Maybe we can just uh Okay. So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent. So thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided. Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether. That would be easier. No it did not work. She send it to me by email. So maybe this is better, to send it by email. Okay? So yeah I I'm it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI uh where is that, it's here. Participant one at AMI. Okay. So see you after lunch break.
@highlight
So we are here for the functional design meeting mm I will take notes during this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time We have a technical problem uh .
@highlight
Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ?
@highlight
With the the whiteboard ?
@highlight
So um the question well first of all what to control .
@highlight
So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that .
@highlight
and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .
@highlight
so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff .
@highlight
the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever .
@highlight
Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah .
@highlight
so the user interface will consist of two parts .
@highlight
Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .
@highlight
What do you mean by linear access then ?
@highlight
Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .
@highlight
For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?
@highlight
and also parameter changing .
@highlight
So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic Voice command w we could specify anything .
@highlight
We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , Um I dunno if you can open the Short-cut to AMI shared folder ?
@highlight
Maybe you can send it to me by email .
@highlight
I will try to show it to everyone , in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .
@highlight
seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot .
@highlight
Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks .
@highlight
Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control .
@highlight
F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons .
@highlight
but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .
@highlight
So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use .
@highlight
And uh remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah .
@highlight
We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel .
@highlight
Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the for the younger it's very important To have L_C_D_ and voice .
@highlight
and speech recognition .
@highlight
And uh and the others is not so important So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing .
@highlight
Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important .
@highlight
but I think we have some technical problem or so .
@highlight
So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .
@highlight
Basically we have a a battery a power supply here .
@highlight
After that we just have um user interface .
@highlight
which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that .
@highlight
Push button or a L_C_D_ .
@highlight
After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip .
@highlight
So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component .
@highlight
Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that .
@highlight
So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .
@highlight
I would say uh about eight months to have the first results .
@highlight
How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?
@highlight
Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .
@highlight
and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ?
@highlight
another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .
@highlight
so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product .
@highlight
So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , So few buttons , channel , volume control Maybe switch T_V_ on and off I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back .
@highlight
Maybe we can include that also .
@highlight
Previous previous channel button .
@highlight
How should they how should we implement that ?
@highlight
Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental .
@highlight
This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .
@highlight
Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .
@highlight
I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this .
@highlight
Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel .
@highlight
So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed I would say the wheel is better .
@highlight
not a a wheel but a ball , so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control .
@highlight
and do we put an L_C_D_ display ?
@highlight
If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ .
@highlight
Just increase the cost .
@highlight
So no L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Yeah .
@highlight
That would be cool .
@highlight
But eight months is really long so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether .","```

ES2007c.json,"Hello. Yeah. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive. Hmm. Do you have any preference uh of order? I think she is still finishing her. Hmm. Okay, it's uh Is it like a crank thing or something. Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. Uh I think, it has to be on the on the solar energy, but I don't know. Let's have a squeezable remote. If it's rubber, isn't it malleable anyway, it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case, mean it's completely flexed, I mean, it it flexes to whatever they want it to? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case? Okay. Okay. Go rubber. Go rubber the whole way. I think push-buttons is Yeah. Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh, 'cause uh The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say, good morning, to it it says, hello Rick, or whatever. But, I mean, it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, but it's not that. It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response. So, yeah, I mean, like what's the point of saying, Hello remote, I mean, hello, how how are you? Yeah, if you're really lonely, it is it's No, tha that w that w that would be more promising. It it's just a remote that talks to you. Uh. I mean to certain cues. 'Kay. Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery. Hmm. Yeah, so we want it rub rubber double curved. So rubber rubber keys, yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. We're giving them a way to burn off steam, basically, yeah. Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful. Oh yeah, I guess T_V_ can be stressful, yeah, if you're watching sports. Alright. Alright. Yeah, some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about. Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic. And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division. It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um, 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out. Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, uh like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. It's it's pointless. Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_. Uh so yeah, they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod. Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing. Um the other suggestion, and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general, but they suggested uh, you know, going i a little bit into a a niche, like either gearing our remote towards kids, where you could have lot of colours um, the keys might be you know, funny or or, or uh something for the elderly, where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But you know we can we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well. Uh um So, the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh, good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department. So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V_ on both of them, so uh it's sort of confusing for the user. Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. And for something for kids. Yeah. Um. And so, yeah, I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um. Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense. I think it should be more general. I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us. And, yeah, that's it for me. So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh. So, yeah, it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons. Um. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons, ideally, I mean a a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad. Uh. And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that. Well now that we've decided on our Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy, but um Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere, like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow, or something like that. I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before. I mean, 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button. But I think that should be I mean um, I can speak with the button department, but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating. So that should be simple. Mm. Yeah. Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense, I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I mean, these first two points we've already sort of gone away from, 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction. And it's it's not technologically innovative either. Mm. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics? Yeah, that's basically what it allows you to do, right? Yeah, the that wouldn't be the remote so much, I mean Mm. Yes, so can Yeah, we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator. we're all about that. Okay, so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them.. Yeah, that's great for us. Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend, I guess. Uh-huh. The power button could be like a big apple or something. They don they don't own all images of apples. Okay, we'll make it a uh pomegranate, a big pomegranate.. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Sure. The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes, and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote. I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take? Mm. Yeah I mean, that that seems to work well with for products like iPod, where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing. Right. Yeah. Okay. Oh right. Yeah. That sounds good. Mm. Right. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Mm, I think we all know what we need to do now. Okay. Okay, I'll stay in here. Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check, or is that So we're buying fut I mean, we're getting futures in the company. So we really have a incentive to make this remote work. I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits, because that's really doing well. Yeah.. This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots. Yeah, we're definitely not in the money making department. Well I I did notice looking at I mean, they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable. I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page, it's not obvious. R_R_. Well it is to us, because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine, but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black. No. Mm. Okay. Right, well, I guess that's us. Okay. Right.
Oh right okay. I cover myself up.. I've always wanted one of these, I really have. Where do you buy 'em from? They're. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Mm-hmm. Batteries. It's here. Ah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing, I think you'll realise that rubber is more People. What about the just developed uh sample sensor? G there, the sample sensor, sample speaker thing. Mm, I dunno. Be cool. Channel two. Oh, it just gives an answer. Oh, then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said, voice recognition, they meant um like, channel five, and it will change. Like you talk to it. Can I have channel five? Oh, then forget about it. Oh right okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. So it will look like something like this.. Yeah. Well the rubber push-buttons. Don't you have to move your Mm. Mm. Yeah, the rubber's good. Yeah, so they can sit there and go like Mm. Mm. That does get annoying. Uh-huh. Well Maybe we can Right. Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year. Um. So yes, so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market, we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed. Um the most important aspect is look and feel. So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. So it has to be Yep. Exactly. Um second, uh it should be technologically innovative innovative. So Technologically it should be like um work, basically, I guess. It should work. Should That's new. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So, no loose That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth, and it's like a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's gonna like, oh, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Well, they do, but it's like it's not Yeah, but it looks good. If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration. But like You could always insert, yeah. Yeah, but, I mean, people like Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Well, it doesn't Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, that was just an idea, but like it needs do something that, you know, is new. Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor, you know, like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there, and people've already seen it, people've already got it. If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative. And then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. I think, safety s Yeah. Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use. And I think we've all um worked that out. Um okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. So next year people will be buying, I found this really funny, you know, strawberry shaped chairs, and things. Yeah. Rubber things. Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, so it's it's not quite spongy, but spongy, I would say is yeah, so we're in. Yeah. And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel, while still keeping to the company's image, basically. So yeah.. I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. Some sort. Or Mm. Well I think, if it's rubber it needs to be different. I think, it's it should be I mean, what do you associate with rubber? You know like really different colours basically. Okay, sor I sorry, I used the wrong word, what do you associate with the mate the material that material? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours. Bright natural colours, nothing too Bright, but too not yeah. Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah. And on the back of it have the logo. Well I can say in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, Mummy I wanna buy that one. And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well, because it's um like kids won't break it, it's not breakable if you throw it around. Especially with younger kids, you know they can pick it up and and Yeah. The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it, but Yeah. So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families, like like family use as well, so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it, I think. Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something. Yeah. So like you walk in, you're like, oh I like that remote control, because it's so bright, and then, and then the shop assistant comes up and says, oh what colour would you like? and then they go like, oh I can choose the colour wow. So it puts, I think, even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of, you've got all colour it's either that or nothing. So they also get to pick. Well, personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour. It's um Yeah. Mm. D you've got the Evaluation. Mm. Yeah. S This gives you all the details? um. Yeah. Mm. Mm.
. Almost. Mm 'kay. No no no no, it's fine I'm just preparing. Okay. Where is that thing? Oh sorry, couldn't see. Would that work? Okay, so that's me again. Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches, if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah, yeah. It wouldn't be very fancy. You can have a kinetic provision of energy, which is used on some watches these days. So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work. Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but Yeah. I dunno actually. I dunno. Um. Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really. And uh if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that. For the case of the remotes itself, um they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one, if you know what I mean, so You know, kind of more ergonomic, that kind of suits the palm of your hand, that kind of thing. So Um then the case material itself, so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex, uh rubber, wood, or titanium. And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium, you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material, so we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing, so we could uh Yeah. Yeah. And also it doesn't break as easily maybe, I dunno So rubber would be Okay. Uh s so if d okay. And then there are the push-buttons, so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, um or you could have um L_C_D_, which gives you a display. Um scroll buttons, as well. So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push-buttons. So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case. Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. So it's a constraint. Yeah, but is it a double curved one or not? If it's not a double curved, then we've got the choice for the push-buttons, if it's a double curve, we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons. If that makes sense. Yeah.. No, but na le you see, you've got, okay, the energy that's one thing, then you have the case is uh, whether it's flat or curved. And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not, but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat, single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why, but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons. So, either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case. Let's go crazy. And then, do I have a last slide? Yes, I do. Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons. Um and the price that go with it with it, so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest. Uh if we get a scroll-wheel, that's a higher price range. If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_, the display thing, then that's even more expensive. Mm.. Yeah. The infra-red. Yeah. Well, if if it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. It's less expensive mm Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job, too. Fo It doesn't, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah. So let's not go for the Yeah, yeah. I agree. So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons. Well It'd be it'd be cool, but they are saying they've just developed it, I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and Hm. Just if you are really lonely, maybe. Channel five. And then it switches on. Okay, so I'll go back, maybe, to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem, what we should choose. So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option. Are you happy with that? Okay. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved? Double? Okay, so then if we use double curved case, then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons, and that's fine? P Yeah. I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't. Mm. Alright, that's me done. Sorry. Well Bluetooth would, for example, enable you, I think, to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now. Things like that. No i No, but if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to I with the television, yeah. I was just trying to find an advantage. Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then. It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for remotes, yet. Change the batteries ever again. Yeah, well, and in little characters you say, yeah, but not too much. Yep. No vegetables. Well yeah, but Apple would sue you for that. sued the Beatles so Yeah. Why not? I'm gonna write that down. That's yeah. Although I'd be curious to see how many uh You know, there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose, and I would be curious how many people choose that colour. Mm. And produce less of the silly colours, maybe. Yep. Alright. Mm. Cool. It is. Great. That's true. Doesn't Yeah. Are we taking these off?
I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on. Right. Hello everybody. Back again for another wonderful meeting. Is uh everyone ready? Okay, we c we can hold on for a minute. I figured with the spam thing, if you can't beat it, join in. Are you ready? Okay, right, well, I take it that you are all ready now. Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting. Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing, and who we all are and stuff like that, mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on. Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing, now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that, that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before, see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today. Um yeah, we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations, whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want. Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first. I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that yeah, let's let's hear from you first. Get yourself in position. I don't think any of us remember the fifties. Do sol solar panel things, do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb? Does anybody know? Okay. Mm. Okay, jolly good. What's a double curved one? Okay. So that might be an idea of using the rubber, but then it should, you know yeah. when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost, you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you. Yeah, I like that idea. Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? You think you can market that? Ooh, we like rubber, ooh. Uh-huh. Well, we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel? rubble double double. I'll have a Big Mac, please. Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. Yeah. Simple, yeah. Chip on print. It's a bit. Okay, uh what I'm not understanding here is uh, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender? Right. Um what a what alternatives do we have to that? Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print? so it sounds So, why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the the unit. I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works, you know. So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print. Yeah. S yeah, push buttons. What about what? Well, what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? S Yeah. It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Basic battery. It's cheap, it's cheerful, it's worked, does work. We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber, weren't we? The the The double whopper, please. Yep, but we're going for the simple buttons. Yeah. And it's cheapest all round, it sounds kinda funky, and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_, and this is anti-R_S_I_. So that's another marketing point that we can use. But anything is gonna have buttons. Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive. You You see, you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury, whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen. It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement. It's not actually what you are doing. But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Yeah. And you know, yeah, you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah. Okay, Gabriel. Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface. Great. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we have an uh example of a good one? Brilliant. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The um The the um the interface type we're going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, and we're not yeah. Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything, you know, colours or particular gimmicky bits to it, we're not we're just gonna go for something We're Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okey-dokey. Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this. Let's move over to Yeah, sure.. Yeah, the button that just does that, yeah. Cool. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_? What's that mean? Okay, now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap. Yeah. Maybe we could um Of course, they do. One hundred per cent, that's your first thing, you go, oh I'm not gonna buy that, 'cause I dunno if it works or not. Okay, well, what do you two think about this? Yeah, what I don't understand what m Yeah, and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television. It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, does it? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well. No, that would be your telephone in with your television. Yeah, and i Nah, the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically. An and there is no there is no such thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this that's that's very good. And and this is all tying in very nicely. The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about. Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up by doing it. But yeah, by the squeezing it the Yeah, that's a great idea. Well done. Yeah. I wanna watch the pineapple channel. Well spongy, that's where. Yeah, we're we're ahead of the game there. Okay. Alright, yeah, no, this i this is good, so through all that we've we go we're right, we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing, that's great, using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself, you are charging the batteries, and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though.. Yeah, this is true. Well, okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image. Like, yeah, we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we dunno what it should be, or like are we going yeah it looks slick, but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing? I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky. L keep it clean, keep it clean. Bright, but not too bright. Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean? Okay, what? Okay. Tha Yeah, I mean we that's we we Yeah. This is the remote control tomato. Yeah. Well, it's it's gotta be chew proof. So, what are you saying, maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the Mm. Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know, if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular. Mm. Okay. Alright. Well um, we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design. Um Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, you know come up with the the user interface design. Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. You won't be going off to your separate offices. Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay. I think, yeah, it's gonna you know, come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas. 'Cause at the moment, uh you know, it's it's hard. We were kinda going, yeah, it's gotta feel nice, it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start, you know, s some sort of physical something or other. Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation. Um. And I will be uh talking to the bosses, basically, and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh that's it really. Keeping things t well, uh you know, ho hopefully uh keeping things together. Um. Yeah, that's This is this is uh good. So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know how it's powered, we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons, we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things, so we've we're keeping the costs down. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff. People, you know, people are saying, oh, standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury, well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite, It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it. Um. you know, we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it, you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have? We'll look into this lock key facility, although whether or not it happens, or is possible, I don't know, but something to look into. Okay. I think that's um well done everybody. Anyone have any uh any questions, everyone know what they're doing? 'Cause if you don't, you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it. Okay. right well. It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish. But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire. Um. Um I think, it's uh, yeah, I think, it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product. Yeah, I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. I want a share in the space rocket. Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. Mm. And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one. Okay. Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying, finish the meeting. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet. So maybe you should go back to your own offices. Yeah. Yeah, it says you two

Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting .
@highlight
Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first .
@highlight
Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , You can have a kinetic provision of energy , Or you can use solar cells , Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
@highlight
but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .
@highlight
For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .
@highlight
You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium .
@highlight
And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium .
@highlight
But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .
@highlight
So that might be an idea of using the rubber , And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ?
@highlight
so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .
@highlight
Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .
@highlight
Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?

Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .
@highlight
Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .
@highlight
is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?
@highlight
Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red .
@highlight
If it's something that's inside the the unit .
@highlight
I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .
@highlight
So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
@highlight
What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
@highlight
Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
@highlight
I'm just guessing .
@highlight
But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , a it just gives you a verbal response .
@highlight
Oh , then forget about it .
@highlight
so we want it rub rubber double curved .
@highlight
So rubber rubber keys , yeah .
@highlight
But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic .
@highlight
Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .
@highlight
they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod .
@highlight
So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .
@highlight
I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea .
@highlight
but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .
@highlight
I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .
@highlight
Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense .
@highlight
I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us .
@highlight
So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh .
@highlight
I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .
@highlight
it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .
@highlight
Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .
@highlight
Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have .
@highlight
Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative .
@highlight
now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .
@highlight
I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy .
@highlight
That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
@highlight
Of course , they do .
@highlight
So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .
@highlight
Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have Okay .
@highlight
Yeah , this that's that's very good .
@highlight
Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then .
@highlight
It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .
@highlight
Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .
@highlight
Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .
@highlight
Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .
@highlight
right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .
@highlight
and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .
@highlight
Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
@highlight
The power button could be like a big apple or something .
@highlight
Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .
@highlight
Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
@highlight
from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .
@highlight
Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design .
@highlight
Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this .
@highlight
come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas .
@highlight
Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .
@highlight
Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .

IS1006b.json,"So I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting. Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation. Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part uh I don't remember which is not very good. Ah of course, how to to design this uh this yeah. So um let's go for the three presentations, so first um Marketing Expert. So wait a minute. Mm. Sounds uh Mm uh. Hmm. Okay. F_ five. Mm-hmm. Mm. Why not? Okay uh tha that's look great. Mm-hmm. Okay. Or something we don't know. Mm-hmm. Okay. I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm Mm-mm. Okay. Mm I think it's good, okay. You done a good review. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay. That's good point. Okay. So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um Of the technical function, so uh what effect Okay. Wait a second. Argh. So you're Okay. Let's go. Oh sorry. Okay. Oh sorry. It's off. It's on. Or you want to go to the kitchen. Mm. Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control. Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. S Mm. Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah. Yeah it's it's the same solution, I think. Hmm. Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next, yeah. Mm-hmm. Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh current chan Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh you're finish? Okay. So now the technical aspects of this new device. Mm. You prefer it. Mm-hmm. Okay. To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh. Mm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard, or mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. On Uh train it, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. And what about the price of this component? It mm okay. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. With a keywords and yeah. Mm-hmm mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. No, in no not only speech, yeah. I it's an option. Okay. Sho to to train, okay. Mm. And well, what about the idea of automatic on off on the button, yeah. Wouldn't that make uh arguments? I want uh And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with Mm-hmm. Okay. You have mm something else to say? Uh. No. Okay, thanks. So mm mm I think, okay, we're just on time. Um mm mm. So, we're now going to l have the lunch break. Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work, and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting, and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching. So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. Well I think that's all. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible. Yeah, maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um. Yeah, implemented. O okay, we can think about that. And um do you see something else? Uh yeah that's Or maybe you want to phone him. Since now all yeah? Think Uh-huh. And uh And it's answered. Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal. What about people without hand? Yeah. Mm uh okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, so let's to think s so that yeah. I think that could be in the component uh concept uh. It yes. Okay. So, yeah, let's go to lunch.
Sammy Benjo. I know this name uh. We met before. F_ F_ five. Agree. R_S_I_ mm-hmm. No, I don't think so. Okay. But twenty six percent, do you know Twenty five. Every fourth, you know. Every four some of us knows. One of us Mm-hmm. Functions. Mm-hmm. I got one question, uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not? Okay, then teletext is used less. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. That's me. That's but this but number three, yes. Mm-hmm. So, my name is Mark Dwight, and um I am responsible for User Interface Design. However, uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. Uh, as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this. So next slide please. And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor. We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control, nothing more. Nothing more than this, just a remote control. 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use. So, make a click, please. So here is this remote control. It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a T_V_, it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know, we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels and maybe some options or something else, and please make a click, compared to this one which one would you prefer? I guess this. Sure, sure. Yeah, and our method is going to be, provide simple simple desires into simple actions. Findings. Our question of the style, we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it. Concept. Be simple. Be simple and you'll lean on this market. Market is a of remote controls you know it better, it's very well, it's it's not an easy field to to play, you know? So be simple. For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium. It's a really good style, it going to be look like like this. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours, and we can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen. And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click, 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something, you always try to find a good button and click it, but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch. So Press I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium I think, and uh what else? I got just very few and good ideas. We need power and volume. And let us include two nice features into this device, first, power on and off can be made fully automatic. When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the T_V_, the T_V_ turns on. When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time like uh you It's a question to our technical design, our two engineers. And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control. Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you. Like, you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something, and then the volume changes. It's easy to do, you just control the According to the distance. Yeah yeah yeah. So I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left, right, up, down and enter. So, its main purpose in fact is a back light, which change colours, which makes it easier to find, and each can it can respond for your voice, like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily, yeah? So basically that's it. Can be easily done, 'cause you got simple designs, y we should put it to simple actions. Let it be universal, so you want to use it for your hi-fi system. You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume. Just few actions, a few actions for everything. All the rest, we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen. Okay, okay. Okay, but it's quite universal you know. We can just extend it to any device. Uh twenty five. Mm-hmm. In fact I would propose another solution. Basically you use just four or five channels, right? Yeah. So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one, two, three and five, and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel. Mm-hmm. Mm. We got these buttons here. Next next. Or say this can be back. Could we carry out some research if we w really need this, like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four? Okay. Okay. Alright? Thanks for your attention. Too complex. Okay. Okay. Um. Okay. No you know it's a conceptual question, 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it, volume up, volume up, and and he's coming you know, he's really annoyed with this, down, up, down. Okay, for this budget like twelve Euros. Mm-hmm. Okay.. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition? Like, if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up or roll 'em down. Mm why? That's just We got a really good Market Expert. Let's send more, let's sell more. Okay. Uh, should it be equipped with the uh, with uh speakers? Like, you want to find it, you shout control, and it answers is I'm here? Or Just beeps? I can't whistle. No, no, I can't. Mm. Okay. Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping. Yeah, I got it at my home, like. Oops.
So Of course. Nice stuff Who starts? Oh. Ha. okay. So I dunno if I can do that like this? Yeah? So it's being modified. Do you want yeah, open. Read only. I hope I saved it. So, um yeah, this is my name. So as you know, you I think you already know me, Sammy Benjo. I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls, and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly. So next please. Uh-oh. Hmm. Yeah maybe in the full page because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation, so. Uh-huh hmm okay. So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls, what they like, what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful. Don't forget about that. So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey. And next please. Yeah, so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all, they find it very ugly. Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they're all the same, and they're not l good looking. Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control, so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um. And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another. And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used, so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. Um next please. Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is. Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please, where are you? Like uh something to to like t I think phones. Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality. Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control. But why not? Yeah. And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use, in fact they don't even know how to use them, so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls. And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_. So I think they are bad. Mm-hmm. Mm nobody has any idea about that? Well I'll check uh with my Oh, okay, I think it's a technical thing which our Okay. So, it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account. So anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um what else do I have? Next slide? Ah yeah. So we've listed a couple of uh s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant. People want to have a power button. Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant. Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury. We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentation so yeah, channel selection is um very important, very often used. Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course. And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant, even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least, so. I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this, which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think. But but if you compare with these ones, uh I think they scored a one or two. Not very relevant, so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant. That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful. For instance I think net next slide. One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down. So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control? I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course, depends on that. And um I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time the meeting was very tight, so that's basically my findings. And uh, if you have any question? I can go back. Yeah one question, yeah? I am. I think we should aim at the young people. But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device. In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people, less than more than Then teletext is useless for them I think, yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah. But yeah. Nope. 'Kay? So I think it's you, huh? No? No, user requiremen Makes sense. I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button. Nice. Nice sentence. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. And when does it turn off? Oh so you have a sensing sensor machine that uh knows Tech Mm-hmm. According to your distance to and the angle maybe, if you have a stereo system. Uh I'm not sure about the screen, wha what is the use usefulness of the screen? Uh is it a touch screen by the way? So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow. Okay. Okay. So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five, how would I do can I do that with this? Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now. You know these days we have hundreds of channels, that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels. Or is it? Most people yeah. In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen, instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three, twenty eight, forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button. I uh B yeah. Go to channel twenty five. One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap. So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels, just because this is one kind of thing they do, zapping. And it's only next. Yeah so but you have to Okay. So it would be Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Listening more. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe. I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that. Although I don't know. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But uh very very good to sell. Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them, and ha ha you cannot use my remote control, because it's targeted to me. Whatever. Hmm. Cheap. Millions. Cheap. The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume, up, down. Okay. Okay. Couple of words. Okay. Of course uh it has to be Okay. But then I think you you First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons. It's on top of using the button. Well, I dunno. T_V_. Very expensive, no? And volume control. So but uh Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control. We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings. Hmm. Yeah, of course. That's no problem, we will sell more. Yeah exactly. Okay. Thanks. Mm great. Difficult. Mm-hmm. No. Speakers in the remote cont Oh yeah. It just beeps. That would be enough. Something very cheap. But that's ex that's expensive. Uh. Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that. You can't whistle. Uh-huh. Or a clap. You can clap. Can you? Clap is good. Tak Just a suggestion. With only one hand? These are not our target people. Mm-hmm. Oh that's e that already exists okay okay. Oh yeah, you do have. Wow. You're trendy. Think about it. Yeah, okay. Okay. Good we're done? Right, thanks.
Yeah, it is put F_ five. The full page presentation, yep. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can you are. Hmm. Yeah, it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect. Yeah, because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology, and those waves have high Uh. Uh. Yeah it's People really Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Hmm. Yeah. 'Cause Thank you. Mm. Mm. Mm, yep. Thank you. Uh it's techni function of Yeah. I have to do working design so uh. Mm. It's Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two li S you should yeah. Mm. Distance. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yeah and it mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display, like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because Yeah. But still Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices. Yeah. Yeah. Two. Yeah, if Sorry. Yeah. Uh as you know, I am mister Ramaro. I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators. So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control. Well, as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device, like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera. So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_. So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device. And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface, which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that. And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device. It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information. Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want. So, basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components, mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want, and then we have some chip, it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format. And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device. Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations, and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s, so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things. Yeah yeah, because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands, which are really good. So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device. So we need to have particular encryption codes. Then, components, so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device. Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components. And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface, so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure, because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy, so we can have another, like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip. Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery, so this battery, once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah, so that we just use simple recog no but but Yeah. No, even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that, because we want to have uh millions and in bulk, so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power, switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel, so users can listen. Ye No, yeah, a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase, so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah. And then we can have channel they can say, okay I want eight, because we don't know like users have different programmes, I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number, we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem, it's it it will be take care of our main mm. Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on, on and off, this processor and This really, suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power, volume and this part and this D_S_P_s. Again, this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form, like volume and like this key. So it may not be like very expensive, because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control so and we have only few things here Yeah. Um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and Yeah, even automatic on off is also a bit problematic, because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and Yay yeah. Yeah that can be possible, especially for power settings, so user can say okay, suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I They can make Yeah we can have Yeah. Uh, not very much, like yeah. Thank you. Yep. Thank you. Can you just yeah. Yeah yeah. Mark will Uh it's in current price, yeah. Yeah. But speech recogniser can be possible. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah, especially the power, it really consumes because it should be all the time on and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think it's good. But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it. Oh. Ah it's Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, thank you very much.
@highlight
I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .
@highlight
I will take the minutes we need uh to know the the user uh needs we want to know how it going to work third part uh I don't remember let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .
@highlight
So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo .
@highlight
I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls what they like , what they don't like So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .
@highlight
First of all , they find it very ugly .
@highlight
uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um .
@highlight
and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .
@highlight
And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .
@highlight
people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ?
@highlight
Like uh something to to like t I think phones .
@highlight
Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality .
@highlight
And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls .
@highlight
And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .
@highlight
Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .
@highlight
but we have to take this into account .
@highlight
now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury .
@highlight
So we've listed a couple of uh Functions .
@highlight
that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .
@highlight
People want to have a power button .
@highlight
Channel selection is uh o often used very often used Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume And All of them .
@highlight
they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant .
@highlight
It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .
@highlight
I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .
@highlight
if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .
@highlight
So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age .
@highlight
Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant .
@highlight
And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down .
@highlight
So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?
@highlight
I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider .
@highlight
If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so that's basically my findings .
@highlight
should we aim at the young people or not ?
@highlight
I think we should aim at the young people .
@highlight
But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .
@highlight
In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , Then teletext is useless for them I think , Because they they have other means of finding their information .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .
@highlight
However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .
@highlight
that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .
@highlight
And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task We should never complicate things too much .
@highlight
We should only make a remote control , nothing more .
@highlight
Nothing more than this , just a remote control .
@highlight
'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .
@highlight
So here is this remote control .
@highlight
It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something .
@highlight
But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily .
@highlight
Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .
@highlight
Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two compared to this one Our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .
@highlight
It is unbreakable and it is very universal .
@highlight
W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen .
@highlight
We'll need only few buttons .
@highlight
All the other things can be controlled through the screen .
@highlight
And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium We need power and volume .
@highlight
And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .
@highlight
When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , the T_V_ turns on .
@highlight
And when does it turn off ?
@highlight
When you don't touch the control For for enough time And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control .
@highlight
Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .
@highlight
Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .
@highlight
Uh I'm not sure about the screen , According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .
@highlight
wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?
@highlight
Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?
@highlight
I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .
@highlight
but uh it has to be with an back light somehow .
@highlight
So basically that's it .
@highlight
Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .
@highlight
Can be easily done , Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah .
@highlight
but it's quite universal you know .
@highlight
We can just extend it to any device .
@highlight
for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ?
@highlight
You know these days we have hundreds of channels , In fact I would propose another solution .
@highlight
Basically you use just four or five channels , set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .
@highlight
But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .
@highlight
So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .
@highlight
But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers Mm .
@highlight
We got these buttons here .
@highlight
Next next .
@highlight
Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .
@highlight
but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?
@highlight
I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .
@highlight
Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro .
@highlight
I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .
@highlight
as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera .
@highlight
So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .
@highlight
so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that .
@highlight
And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .
@highlight
uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , we ought to have some kind of processor And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .
@highlight
because the people don't use one particular brand so So we need to check their specifications So we need to have particular encryption codes .
@highlight
so I'll input the connections to all this components .
@highlight
so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .
@highlight
Mm-hmm .
@highlight
And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm .
@highlight
and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .
@highlight
and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .
@highlight
Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , And what about the price of this component ?
@highlight
Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down .
@highlight
And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else it will be complicated First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .
@highlight
actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?
@highlight
Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up or roll 'em down .
@highlight
Very expensive , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .
@highlight
even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control .
@highlight
We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .
@highlight
Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I we're now going to l have the lunch break .
@highlight
Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching .
@highlight
of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .
@highlight
And we have um maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?
@highlight
Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .
@highlight
But speech recogniser can be possible .
@highlight
Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?
@highlight
Like , you want to find it , you shout and it answers is I'm here ?
@highlight
Or But that's ex that's expensive .
@highlight
Uh .
@highlight
Just beeps ?
@highlight
I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .
@highlight
You can clap .
@highlight
Can you ?
@highlight
But it's a good feature I guess yeah we're done ?
@highlight
let's go to lunch .
@highlight
because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording","```

IS1004d.json,"What this button for? Okay. But if you want to go to page seven hundred? How man I don't understand it. Can you repeat it? Yeah. Ah okay okay. Okay. Okay okay. Okay. I see. I see. Okay. Okay. Is it really weight? Is it light or Okay. Okay. Ok Okay. Yeah yeah yeah, I see. I under I understand. How long the how long the bit the batteries long. I l yeah. I like I like it. Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons. Looks a bit Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say that. You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not And the volume button will will become And what about people who want to use digits? Butto real buttons? Okay. Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff? It's all automatic. Okay. Okay yeah it's fine. W we are living in a wonderful world. Automatically configure. Yeah. S Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements. And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven. Because i I'm sorry. Sorry. Ah yeah. It's from sorry, it's from one to seven. It's from from one to seven sorry. Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale, and five is too short and nine is too long. I'm a I I'm Sorry? Yeah yeah. The variance is mi it's is minimal. I'm um answering your question. Okay. And that's the criteria I I found more useful. I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard? And we all four could range could evaluate the Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Seven but I would say seven. It's quite fancy. Six. Six. I would say Everything ar Mm everything It's compared to the all remote controls. Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s? Yeah. Four. Four. So four? It means cool features, like new features actually. I would say five. You said seven? Five. Sorry, I have them Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end. I find it quite cheap actually. I dunno. If i i it depends, if you live in in Switzerland or you live in I don't know. Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or Yeah this is the the initial specifications. I would say six. It's quite cheap actually. Actually maybe Yeah I change the question. So yeah upload the Yeah it's two different situations. If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one. So? What now? What range? Six. Six? Six? Six, so it's uh five point five, or less. Actually yeah, I we Five? You are romantic, really. I would say two. Who is the outlier? Wh wh you said five? I don't know if it's a No because there are more yeah, we shouldn't sum like that. Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually. Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell. Uh no I didn't anything. Yeah, the uh Yeah. Do you want me to sum o I think it's not S Actually what's the differen Too expensive. Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two, because there is another chip here. Yeah but you need Fo i it does nothing actually? Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy. Would yeah, would buy. Yeah because th th the evaluation project Ah would buy, yeah. Massively, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times, so. And you said the lowest. Yeah, for the batteries Mm-hmm. So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_. The complexity shouldn't be much higher. For you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would Bye.
Okay so we can go to the slides. Yeah. Number three. Oh number two sorry. So final design. Final design. Okay so Michael you can go ahead. You can pull it out first, maybe. Uh And we we do have one more functionality. If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button, so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_. The turbo button. Additional button. That's right, that's right. So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing. And you can tele yeah, once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or vol volume. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it always means, whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage. It's like antennas. And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries. It is very light. Yeah. And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana. Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh we didn't think of that yet. Yeah. Oh yeah that's right. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there. Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is. Eight to ten eight to ten hours. N most no most of the time it's not being used. So when when you are making it on Mm. Mm-hmm. No eight or eight or ten hours of working. If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. And we are having the speakers regular chip for control. Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. And uh that's it. That's right. You want to have more functional buttons? You are not convinced. Not not many, we we want to keep it simple. So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case, that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that, the channel buttons, they baco become the scrolling buttons. It's up to you, means. Now that Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits. That's right. Yeah. So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape. So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing, they they don't care about the buttons any more. And anyway Evalua yeah. Why this strange factor of seven? Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay fine, got the idea. Okay. Okay, okay, great. Okay. Yeah yeah. Go ahead. Mm-hmm. Sure. Okay. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So you can say fancy, handy. Handy. Yeah, it's fancy, according to me. Seven. Seven by me. Okay. So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus Five. Again I'll give seven. Yep. Seven for me. I'll give five. That's right. That's right. The standards. What is available in the market off the shelf. We Five. So four point two? four. There I'll give it seven. That's right. For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature. And then the scroll buttons are again cool features. We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have. Mm-hmm. Seven. Okay. Definitely seven. Okay. I'll say five. I'll say five. Why? No but it's really handy actually if you see. It's it's so handy. And then Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this. It's a very positive thing if you see like that. Youngsters. You want to flaunt. You with your girlfriend or something. Or might be it does some other kind of thing but Uh yeah, crazy. I say five. And you have saved it? You'll have to reload. They're not going to be as And they they might not be a as easy as this yeah. Yeah. S I go slightly up. Six. Six, five, four. Okay. I'll still give it five. Yeah. So it's somewhere three point five I think. No I said five. Mm-hmm. Oops. Yeah it's it's funny. Yeah, sure. Mm-hmm. Solar cells, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, we said no to that. I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing. Yeah. To bring the cost Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one. And that's it. And we have sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah. the cost of that is very high. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And we have sev Yeah. So we we'll put some extras, if there is something. Okay. To reduce the cost, it's okay. Oh it's got all the directions so don't worry. It's got a direction. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's right. We don't have any push buttons. No that is a scroll wheel itself, it'll be put in that. Ah okay, okay. Okay, okay. Yeah. No. There's no chip there. It just emits the signal. And the receiver accepts it and that's it. Just se sends the signal, that's it. Yep. No. Yeah. So first thing which we should take care of is, instead of rubber, let it be plastic. And uh that much money will be required for the base station, which is not there. Yeah. That's right. So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go That's right. Yeah. S Detachable battery. They like that. Mm-hmm. Biased. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The cost of the thing can be made more than might be. Because I think it's just the optimal, what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to. Interface. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's right. Yeah. Integrate. Mm-hmm. So What else? Okay. Home? Happily satisfied. Mm-hmm. Thank you.
Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana remote okay so we actually have a We've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself, it's kind of it's it's ergonomic, it fits in the hand uh rather well. We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally. This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Yeah. Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops. But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture. The T_V_ yeah. The s the turbo button. So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button. This is a teletext button. So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh To navigate yeah. Yeah. Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing, you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f Mm uh And this is the uh the infrared uh port. Also the top of the banana. So. And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana. Actually they do. That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object. Yeah. So. But yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station. So. Okay. It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana. You know, to give you the correct look and feel. I think a child would try to eat it anyway, so maybe we should consider that. maybe health and safety aspects. Yeah. I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station. If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore. Mm. The what sorry? What do you mean? Ah. Ah. A long time. No no no, it can it should be weeks. Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so Ah, okay. Okay. Yeah. It seems to be falling over. Or can move between positions in the in the number. It's all automatic. Yep. Uh. Yeah uh five. Five, maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's yeah. I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote, 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote. Yeah. Well it depends when you say functional, do you mean it does what we want it to do, or d does what it does, you know, can it make you coffee? You know. Yeah. Yeah. That's before Yeah. I have to say four. Well it's not a universal remote. Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s. Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess. Four. Just four. Obviously there are some outliers so Which I'll say five. Yeah. S yeah. 'Cause it's five five seven seven so Uh, okay, definitely easy to use. Seven. Alright, now here's the sixty million Dollar question, well, twenty five twenty five Euro question. What do you what do you guys reckon? Hmm. Uh Yeah. Yeah. I'd say two. I don't want a banana on my living room table, a banana remote. It is handy, it's handy, but it it's terrible. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not a positive thing. Well, you know, it's it's handy, it's ergonomic, but it's a banana. Yeah but it says I, I would buy this, so. No, it's I. I would buy S s Still I I'd say two. I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control, really. I can say, maybe there is a market for it, I dunno. Yeah. Okay, so, it depends if uh If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it. Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than a banana. And it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use. Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so I dunno. Um. I'd give it I'd give it a I give it a four now. Yeah. I'd say three, I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible. If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh I'd say a three. It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters. Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up? Well just leave it at that then. No. I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it, so. Well we decided against the solar cells so You mean, charging it by shaking the banana. Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually Yeah. Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that, we're just using the the very beep simple beep, that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything. So Yeah. I say that Yeah. Mm. Well, wait a second, no, it's it's double curved, it's got a c, it's uh Well d yeah it's monotonic but it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved, one on this side, one on that side, but they're opposite sides. This is actually I mean this probably this probably actually costs more than three if you Yeah. Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber if you drop it? Well when okay. Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in. Yeah. No, we have two push buttons. Huh. Uh. Okay it's gonna have to be plastic. It's a recharger thing and uh Well I actually did um think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class. You know. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that. Yeah. No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons. Make it plastic instead of rubber. And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents. Yeah. Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic. Does that include charging circuitry and everything? So what do we do with the extra profits? Okay. The next fruit. No we have a product which none of us would buy. No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it. We're n yeah. We're not in Milan or Paris. Actually there were a lot of That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan. Okay so um project process. Yeah. I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity. And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting. We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it. Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless. Yeah. Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well, to see you know how to how to market this thing. 'Cause you know if well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid, then you know, banana remote control could be fun for them as well. Might have to draw a face on it. So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market. Yeah. I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside, I'm not sure really how complicated our um our needs are. I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers, do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that. And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff, that would be rather cool. I think that's actually something that should be in version two, is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room. Yep. Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Good afternoon again. So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control. Um So here is the agenda for today. Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two, sounds interesting. And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts. Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro. Okay. So let's go. Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting. So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions. No L_C_D_, no speech recognition technology, okay, we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control. We went through the use of wheels and but buttons. And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost. Okay. Um. Good. So guys let this uh wonderful thing. Oh yeah. Sorry. Um. Which is Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe. Mm-hmm. What's the use uh of the t turbo button already? Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops. Uh-huh. Which one? Okay. To navigate it through th through teletext. with the wheel it's easy. Excellent. Calling. Excellent. And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas? Oh. Great. So, what else? Yeah, they're light. Ah yeah. So for the power source, apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries. Uh you mean okay. So Yeah, where are going to where are you are you going to place them? You have enough surface? You Okay. What will be the autonomy? Roughly? The autonomy. Autonomy. Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station? Yeah. A long Yeah, so it's It's used only when you Yeah. F weeks. Right. Next slide? Okay. Okay. Those really sounds very good. Nothing else to add? Yeah. Well in fact b both will be could be useful, navigating through teletext. Yeah. Wow. Very good uh yeah you th yeah. Bananas everywhere. Okay, so So we have to go through now evaluations. So your slides are ready? Uh you're four I think. So this is one, which one is this one? Num number So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation. Okay. Okay. Yeah, six. S seven. Six. No, wait. What do you say seven? Five? Okay, six point five. Handy? Seven. So seven, seven, six, six point five. Functional. Four. Uh for a remote control, does he have all the you could expect. Yeah. So it's universal but for T_V_s. So s uh four? Five? Four. Four. Okay cool? Cool device. Yeah. Seven. Six. Plus six, I say I said seven. So it's six. Yeah. Seven. Seven. And you? Outl you are not lik outlier. Seven Okay okay okay okay. Of course I'll buy the banana. Well Twenty five Euros. Cheap. Yeah, so the target price is for all Europe, or only for rich countries? It's more targeting U_K_ or So this is selling costs, not production costs. Yeah yeah sure. Um Five. Aw, should be nice in your It's kitsch. Well, don't forget well, don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah, youngst youngst No well yeah I if you would be young. Not telling that you are young. Li li like a teenager for instance. Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things. Yeah. Yeah, you want to show the beautiful banana you have. Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know. So you say two. F I d I say five. You say? So what's the new question? Uh yeah, I think so. Yeah that's two different question. Ugly. I stick to five. W we have six, five Three So we are six, five, four Yeah. So So and last question, will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana. Um, zero. No uh we can't. So one. Well if. No uh let's say I'll put two. It's for the T_V_. Two three five two three fi and two. So it's r Yeah, three point five. No no you say five, he is the outlier. Okay just just do a sum. Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob Yeah. So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling. We can had uh have a out of these numbers, which which is that well we should go for it. Problem with connectors? Okay. So let's move uh let's move on. Okay, now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay. So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet. Um well we are going to calculate the production costs. We should we should be below twelve point five. So I already uh put some pu some numbers here, okay. We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing. So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about. Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells. Oh yeah finally we say no. Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines. So hand dynamo. This something we didn't thought about. But Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we we stick to battery, one. No kinetic also. I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo. Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana. Crazy. Okay. So those banana is falling. Let's go ahead. So we we st only have one for battery. Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No so we hin Yeah so one. Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing. So we are The beep. That's what Okay so I'll remove it. S So don't we need a Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing. So Yeah maybe. We'll see later. Okay so in for the case um I put single curved. Because we have two things. No. Well. What a what i if I put one here. Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right. So we stick to plastic, it cost nothing. No, it's too no. It's too expensive. We're already at eleven. Okay so I put rubber one. Okay so special colour, yellow. Uh for the interface we have We have three. No no. We have two scroll, and we have three push buttons. And No it's no chip. This is just radio frequency. Th This is no chip. It's just Yeah. No. Just only. Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons. Yeah, so Yeah. Okay. So no L_C_D_, so for we have no button supplements, right? Uh well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no, these are these are for colours, co and special forms, special colours and special materials. So Okay so we are over budget. Yeah. Yeah. So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing. Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff. Yeah maybe. Okay good. Wha Excellent. Um we'll invest in R_ and D_. Yeah. So well we're under the the the cost. So we can go to through to project evaluation. Sorry? Which is different. Which is different. None of us will buy it. This is a battery. This is what we which you can mm It did yeah. Extra battery, yeah. Exac Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here. If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say. So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example. Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact. Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen, not that much. Oh yeah it's really creative. Yeah. Yeah maybe we should go through, yeah an uh evaluation. So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well, do you like to have a banana as a remote control. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time? Dunno, oranges? Hmm. Okay. Very good. So Well done. I think we we can go home. Yeah. Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate. Okay so thanks very much. Bye.
@highlight
So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control .
@highlight
Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts .
@highlight
Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro .
@highlight
No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control .
@highlight
And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost .
@highlight
So final design .
@highlight
Final design .
@highlight
well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button This is a teletext button .
@highlight
What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?
@highlight
This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .
@highlight
If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ .
@highlight
once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .
@highlight
And this is the uh the infrared uh port .
@highlight
in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .
@highlight
And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?
@highlight
And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .
@highlight
It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana .
@highlight
And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana .
@highlight
I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .
@highlight
Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?
@highlight
No eight or eight or ten hours of working .
@highlight
If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .
@highlight
Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip .
@highlight
And what about people who want to use digits ?
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .
@highlight
So we have to go through now evaluations .
@highlight
I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements .
@highlight
so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .
@highlight
Why this strange factor of seven ?
@highlight
Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?
@highlight
Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Yeah , it's fancy , according to me .
@highlight
Seven .
@highlight
Seven by me .
@highlight
Yeah uh five .
@highlight
but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels Functional .
@highlight
I'll give five .
@highlight
Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?
@highlight
Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Well it's not a universal remote .
@highlight
Four .
@highlight
Okay cool ?
@highlight
Cool device .
@highlight
There I'll give it seven .
@highlight
For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature .
@highlight
I would say five .
@highlight
I say I said seven .
@highlight
Of course I'll buy the banana .
@highlight
I'll say five .
@highlight
I find it quite cheap actually .
@highlight
I dunno .
@highlight
If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote .
@highlight
Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .
@highlight
don't forget who we're targeting also No , it's I .
@highlight
I would buy I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .
@highlight
So you say two .
@highlight
I say five .
@highlight
If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it .
@highlight
I stick to five .
@highlight
will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana .
@highlight
No uh let's say I'll put two .
@highlight
If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to I'd say a three .
@highlight
So it's somewhere three point five I think .
@highlight
So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling .
@highlight
We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .
@highlight
Um well we are going to calculate the production costs .
@highlight
We should we should be below twelve point five .
@highlight
Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .
@highlight
No kinetic also .
@highlight
So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .
@highlight
And we have sample speaker .
@highlight
Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep simple beep , Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing .
@highlight
So we we'll put some extras , if there is something .
@highlight
I put single curved .
@highlight
To reduce the cost , it's okay .
@highlight
So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .
@highlight
Too expensive .
@highlight
Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber Okay so special colour , yellow .
@highlight
We don't have any push buttons .
@highlight
We have three .
@highlight
We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .
@highlight
Okay it's gonna have to be plastic .
@highlight
but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .
@highlight
So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .
@highlight
Make it plastic instead of rubber .
@highlight
Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic .
@highlight
So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go so we have margin for that stuff .
@highlight
So what do we do with the extra profits ?
@highlight
Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ .
@highlight
So we can go to through to project evaluation .
@highlight
No we have a product which none of us would buy .
@highlight
Okay so um project process .
@highlight
Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here .
@highlight
Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .
@highlight
I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity .
@highlight
And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting .
@highlight
Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .
@highlight
Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless .
@highlight
So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .
@highlight
I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ I think we we can go Okay so thanks very much .","**Meeting Agenda: MANDO Project Update**

ES2010a.json,"Yep. I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing. Artistic skills, nil. I draw like I'm in grade five. I'll go. I drew a kitty. It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat, but I love cats. I love cats because they're independent, uh they pretty much know what they want, they get it, they move on. I'm allergic to cats, too. I still can't sleep with them in my room. Yay. Are you trying to suggest something? Well, we wanna make a multifunctional remote, right? One remote for everything. Um. I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly. Okay. So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals. What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand? What kinda battery would we want to use? Because battery changing is usually Okay. Yeah. Can you with a small lithium battery?
Just do it on the arrow. Fine. No, I kne I knew. Yeah. Ah. In my next life. Um, I drew a badger. Well, yeah. Uh I dunno, they're grumpy and nocturnal and Well, a little bit like the Yes. Um. And then, if you know Wind in the Willows badger. Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian. He's Liverpudlian writer. Um, that kind of books. Badgers are cool in that one too. Now? And everything being Wait, we have what, sound system, T_V_, D_V_D_, V_H_S_, uh TiVo? But it's still there, so if po if we're gonna do it Or if it's not like a Sony, if it's like a I don't know. But at the same time are simple. Just bad ones. Um. D Double A_. Some but Yeah, I guess then it's If we need to do triple A_ we can, but most people usually have double A_s around. Right. Mm-hmm.
Yep. We could Yeah, we could on here. Oh, thanks. I'll go. Um this is my picture. I drew fish I like fish, because uh, you know, their whole water-vascular system thing. It's pretty cool, and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes, sometimes vicious but that's okay. Yeah. Yeah, they they're easy, you know. Yeah. No I I see it. Yeah, it does look like a cat. I'm allergic to cats. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, if you're around them for a long period of time Oh, yeah, this summer I, oh I had to live with cats. It was crazy. Yeah. Cool. Oh, okay. No, that's good. You don't really have to, I mean, if you like 'em Right. Yeah, TiVo. It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal. And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet, because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways. They want like the flashy lights. Oh like this came from Las Vegas. Mm yeah. Double A_. Yeah some use triple A_s. So double or triple? Yeah, if we want it to be more thin, then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_. Right.
Okay. Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing. Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager. And I know all your names again, Courtney, Fenella and Amber. Alright. Okay, so first let's go through this PowerPoint. I wonder what button I press? Yeah, or how about I just click? Okay, here is our agenda for this meeting. Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions. We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better. Um tool training, we're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. Okay, here is our project. We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original, trendy and also user-friendly. And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first, how is it gonna be used, what's the actual goal here, it has to operate T_V_, blah blah blah. And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet. Same thing with conceptual design. Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work, meet. That's pretty much the the whole process for today. And then the detailed design, just more in-depth, get the actual schematics of the remote. Okay. Alright. First we're gonna start off by using our tools. And the whiteboard thing, do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here. Alright, let's go forward then. Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal. Even if you are not a good drawer like me. Alright. Um. Bless you. Oh do I. 'Kay, about one more minute. Okay. Okay. And who would like to start us off? Alright. Only if they're piranhas. Alright. Who wants to go next? No, it looks like a cat. I love cats, too. I'm a cat person. Uh. If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic, but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it, you know, it's weird. Okay. Okay, Fenella? Badger. Good choice. Why a badger? Alright. Okay. And I'm last. 'Kay. Look at my sad sad giraffe. No, no, no, it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur, but whatever. I don't know even much about giraffes, but I just love the way they look. They're just such odd creatures, you know. I I like that they're so unique and individual, I guess. I don't know much about their behaviour or anything, though. Only seen a couple in zoos. Yeah, but you can appreciate the way they look. Okay. Alright. Guess we're getting straight back into business here. Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro, and our profit aim is fifty million Euro. We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States, in Europe, in Asia. And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote. Okay. So we're gonna talk for a little while. Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Expe our experiences with remote controls um, our first ideas about this new remote, anything that you can bring to the table for this project. So. Yeah. You wanna start us off? Anybody have anything to offer? Right. TiVo. They're never universal. That's right. Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product, D_V_D_ player, say, usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah. Yeah. Something from Sam's club. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay, and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product, how it feels in your hand. If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more. They want the ergonomic ones. Yeah. Ones that ones that look high-tech, too. Right. So that people like my mother can use it. Yeah. 'Kay. Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that Yeah. That's true. Do some of them use triple A_s though? Okay. Okay. Yeah. But that has to do with the size of it too. Well, w as long as we know that issue is Here we can Triple A. But it's okay, we don't have to decide about it now, just as long as we remember battery type and size is important. Hey. Anything else? Alright. Moving along. Oh, we're closing the meeting. Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes. Here's what we're going to do. Um the I_D_, which is who? Okay, you're going to think about the working design. What do you think that means? Okay. And U_I_D_, the technical fun functions design, making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do, the functionality of it, operating all those different things. Okay. And the marketing person, that's Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification. I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for. Right? I would think so. Okay. And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while. Okay, so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting? Okay. This meeting is officially over.

IS1009b.json,"Okay, is everybody ready? Mm-hmm. Um I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. You're participant four. Okay, and now I can uh full screen. Uh, okay, okay. Uh okay, can can I at this point interject um something? Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext, because that's sort of outdated with the internet, and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_, mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things, and they are concerned with the time to market. Okay. Um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product, so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company, and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out. So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things, so it's only gonna be T_V_, but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea. Mm 'kay. Okay. And uh who would be next, uh, I guess that would be you. Mm-hmm. You want me to get your slide show up? Mm-hmm. And you are number three? Number two. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah yeah, uh-huh. There, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yo and it's yeah but it's so. Yep. Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated, so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now. Mm-hmm. Yeah I It just build a mould basically and uh you know. As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or Oh yes. I think I think we will have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun, you know. Yeah. Silly for children. Like an animal or Yeah. Yeah, a little elderly, a little arthritic hand you know, and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know. Mm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Holder, yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, you don't have to. This one? And Francine? You are number two? You're three. Would you want it full full screen? Mm-hmm? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. On the on on the remote. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Yes. By your child, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Timer, yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh okay, now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work. So these are the two things we should come up wit with. So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a T_V_. Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_. There are a few but in general not. Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important. Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear. And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not. So this these are just some thoughts I have on it, and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups. Mm-hmm. That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana colour or whatever you know yeah, for example you know. But the question is really, who is our target group. Do we look at one target group? And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect? Right. With with Mm-hmm. Well that's that's Yeah. No The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function, and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know, within the target group or subgroups. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. I mean the basic design I understand will be the same, but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example. So that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. Yeah, well that's that's the question. Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones? They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, and maybe something like that, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package. And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately. You know, yes. That's right, and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package, then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know. Well I think I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way, um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message. Finish meeting now. Um um. But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree, do we? Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. Okay? So now I understand it's lunch break. And um. So that's what we will do. So hank you very much. And we'll see you after lunch.
Yes. Okay. Okay. What features. S sellable. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Receive. Multi-purpose. Eliminated. Mm-hmm colours. Yes exactly. Yes. Like a doll, or Yes. Yes. Okay. Something else. Channels. Yes. Yes. Mm yeah. Yes. Hmm. Okay. To keep the remote? Yeah. A case holder. A holder remote holder. Participant two. Yes. No no, I'm three. I can make it full? Yes yes yes. Okay. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. Yeah can you please go onto the next slide? So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance. Now for that, uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_. There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it. Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice. Yes. Yes. So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time, and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time. So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel. And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability. And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down, like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person. And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock, and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote. Yes, and as John Reece said the buttons can be, uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote, he uh he should not be harmed in any way. And findings, uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used, there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities, there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not, uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock, and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically, so that nobody else comes later and use it. Timer. Yeah and then you can use a timer as well. Yes. Yeah that's it. Okay. T_V_ television we was. Mm-hmm. Different colours. Yes. Okay. No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems, yes. But in a family in a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes. They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh Cost effective. Okay. Yes. Okay. Um Yes. But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people. Okay. Of th okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm. Yes. Okay.
Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you. Okay? Okay you want me to start right now? Okay. Well, could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time. I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh. 'Kay. There we go. Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves, so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it. Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car, it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another, and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those. So that was um what I meant there, and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase, we want somebody to see it and think it's, gee I just gotta have that. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September, 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around, isn't gonna sell for Christmas. Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view. So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you, and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know, what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle, 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle. A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything. I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp. I have to wind up? Yeah, sure. Okay. Okay. Of course, yeah. Okay, so that's something Okay so Okay. Alright, thanks for that. Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address, uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use, and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep, and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate. 'Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Uh because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say you know, be-backs don't come back. If somebody says, oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. And, in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so that's why I'm saying, simplicity is good. Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say, uh twenty five Euros isn't much. Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign. Okay that's uh about it for me right now. Okay. Mm-hmm. Signal. Mm-hmm. Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook. Mm okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well we already eliminated that. Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun the fun shape. And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget? To d the shape is uh Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? Is that gonna be a possible? 'Cause that might help with the marketing. Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. Mm. Well, I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one. The changing modes was something I mean you and I, all f all four of us we work with computers all the time, changing modes is nothing for us, but people who N and And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel, and um you don't feel the mode change. So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. You know, like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it. But we'll get to that with you. That's right, yeah. Now that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a good that's a good one, because the clock would be really friendly, and and when is your favourite show coming on and Yeah, and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen, and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute. Yeah that's that's good, the clock is good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Case. So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? Or Okay. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that. Okay, thank you. Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy? Yeah, okay, thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, 'kay. And an alarm clock, yeah that should that should be okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone. So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull. Mm-hmm. That's right. You can make a banana shaped one. Mm-hmm. Respect. Mm. What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much, is it? That that w that won't change much, will it uh? I d I wouldn't think so. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right, and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case. And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it? Um you as an industrial person? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well there's a real idea yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. Uh yeah. An alternate package. Yeah. Okay. Well I think we can only aff, yeah. Cosmetic. Warning, finish meeting now. Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um Mm-hmm. Okay but we have to l Okay, fair enough. Okay.
Yeah? Mm? Open. And then full screen. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Complicated, yeah, of course. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah 'kay. Yeah yeah sure. Thank you. Number two, yeah. Yeah exactly. Uh can you make it uh full screen please? No, it's like a well you you have to press here. The cup cup shape here? The thir third. Yeah exactly. Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Um can you go to the next sli slide please? The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal, and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices. Uh yeah. Um. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So uh you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions. So can you go to the next slide please? So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also, it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark. And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. And there should be a child lock, like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay, yeah, yeah. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh Yeah, yeah, yeah and colours also, different colours, and No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like, you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more Yeah yeah. It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah. Yeah that will be Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, for children, yeah exactly. Yeah, that's what, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive, so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations, like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel, if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so. Yep, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's like you know yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah you don't us yeah yeah, usually. Yeah. Yeah shapes also, different shapes. Yeah that will Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh So yeah. And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's Yeah, and we display a clock. Yeah. Yeah, and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so Yeah. Yeah. Uh can you go to the next slide please? Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch. And uh bulbs. Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose, then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light. Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source, not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light. Maybe we can have that. Whenever the T_V_ is on, remote controller will have a light. And then uh infrared bulbs. Um this is like uh when it is dark. And battery, there should be a battery for power supply, and a chip, chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations, and wires connecting all chips, which is uh lights, everything, so there should be wires. And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and, you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape. Yeah. Yeah, holder. Um uh can you move onto the next slide. Um next sli slide please. Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website, uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points. That's it, that's it from me now. Um. Uh it's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so. Yeah if you want. Yeah, it's okay. Uh, it's actually there now, there on the screen. Mm. Yeah, sure. If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock. Hmm. It's like a t okay, it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television. Mm, T_V_, yeah. Don't T_V_, yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. We can design different remotes for different people, like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know. yeah. Children and everybody, yeah. Yeah of course that we can do, but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children, like in a different you know. No, it it doesn't cost, yeah. Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Uh no. Mm, I I I don't think no. It's not. Hmm. Yeah, like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers, like designs and all so that w we can have that. Yeah. Yeah, but uh Yeah. Yeah, maybe, yeah, yeah. If we do some more research, maybe we. Hmm yeah, I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah. Mm-hmm. Thank you.
@highlight
I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
@highlight
Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility .
@highlight
So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do .
@highlight
because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present .
@highlight
So it's gotta be really attractive Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .
@highlight
Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible .
@highlight
And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible .
@highlight
At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
@highlight
Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ?
@highlight
Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered .
@highlight
Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now .
@highlight
'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room .
@highlight
uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .
@highlight
We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .
@highlight
Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller .
@highlight
in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller .
@highlight
It takes the power from a battery and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so .
@highlight
and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .
@highlight
Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook .
@highlight
So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so .
@highlight
like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller .
@highlight
And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands you you say that won't add too much to the budget ?
@highlight
No no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like , Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
@highlight
Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of Silly for children .
@highlight
so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons .
@highlight
because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature .
@highlight
So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
@highlight
You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it .
@highlight
And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote .
@highlight
uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .
@highlight
and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel .
@highlight
one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .
@highlight
and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television .
@highlight
And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that .
@highlight
And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability .
@highlight
However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group .
@highlight
And uh what function , working design , how how does it work .
@highlight
Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups .
@highlight
we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use .
@highlight
and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull .
@highlight
I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours .
@highlight
The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense .
@highlight
but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ .
@highlight
can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
@highlight
They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
@highlight
Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um If we do some more research , maybe we .
@highlight
If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
@highlight
Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
@highlight
So now I understand it's lunch break .
@highlight
I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

Do you vote uh Christine? Do you also vote? Well, we can very easily. I So it will have five point five average. Mm. It's four. Yeah. D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not? Huh? No. Okay. Yeah. For twenty five. Yeah. I give a seven, I think. 'Kay. Yeah, we can we can put a seven here. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we hope. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's cool. I think we can put a six here. So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely, or Yeah. Yeah the only problem there might be which know, i if it's very sensitive, they will, I don't know Yeah, okay. Mm. Six, yeah, for me. Yeah. Twenty. Thirty. Thir Okay. Yeah, the top Mm. So will become eight soon? Yeah, well it's a bit biased. Okay. Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped, uh wireless phones not mobile ones, wireless for the house, uh quite big also, and they were selling something like a hundred Euros, two hundred Euros. Just a just a phone, wireless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's much more complex, but Okay. Congratulations to the team. Uh very well, we worked together fantastically. So what does the management say? What does the management say? Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four. Evaluation. Okay. So you can go. We can go through. So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings. So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points. We we talked about before. So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, and robust, uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points. Okay. So I go through all the uh all the points here, and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point, two point or seven point. Okay? And after we ha we have an an average, and uh we see. The okay? Uh so uh fancy look and feel, what do you think? F between o one and seven. Yeah. Seven is the Mm-hmm. sorry. eh? No, I just want to see something Mm-hmm. Uh I think uh and need to as well. Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh. Um. Yeah. Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm. Oh sorry. Six Uh s you can how much what? Oh yes I mm I dunno mm, I think six, it's a good uh Yeah. Wa can. Okay. I sorry. Okay. So after, the technological aspect? So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel. Uh. No. Four. We can put four? Everyone is okay or four poin Four. Okay. Very easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? Mm, six for me also. Six point five. Okay. Is it fashion? Seven? Yeah it's fashion, because it's a fruit, and we say that the yeah, seven. Uh easy to find in a room? Yeah? We have the lightning, or The lighting. Yeah. Seven? Is it is it robust? Everybody is okay, six. Yeah. Okay. S now um so. Thirteen uh, twenty, twenty six point five, uh seven, thirty two, thirty six. That's that's okay? Six. Good. Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better, and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product, I think. We have a good price and uh. Good. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay.
Hi. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I will give a a five. Five. A four also, because, except for the wheel, we don't have so much innovation. The rubber is Uh a four. I I Yeah. Six. Six. Six six six point five. Yeah, seven. Easy to find. I lost my banana. Uh. Six. Yeah, okay. Uh f yeah, it's ru it's rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Six or five. Five. Six. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare. Start to eat banana. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fruits.
Okay. Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype. It really looks like a banana. It is a banana. Mm. Okay. Hi. So we are here for the detailed design meeting. So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting. Then uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual. We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work. And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product. Then we will uh evaluate the product. And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not. So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say uh to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy, and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera. And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. So which is uh good, because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros. So for the financial aspect it's okay, we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if, and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert. Yeah. You have a presentation? Participant four, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe you can presen okay. Maybe hold it. So I think it's uh very uh very nice. What do you think? Yeah. So it's between one and seven? Seven is the highest uh? I will give a six. Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah. No problem. So this is your One is most. Well, we can choose what we want. Okay, let's say that seven is the best. Okay. So so do note the grade we have five, six for me, five. And what what's your choice? How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect? How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire? Five point five average. Okay. Well, does it Okay, techne technological aspect. Yeah, we have the wheel. We also have the rubber material, which make it uh like new also. I think I would give a five. Four? Okay. No. So what's your uh grade? Four? So we have four, four f and five? Yeah, four. Four, yeah, let's put four. Doesn't it Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I would give a I would give a seven as well. It's very easy to use. So six point five. Okay. Oh yeah, its its f its fruit fruit shape. I would say seven. And is very very nice design. Yeah. Seven, okay. I think you can't miss it. Okay. Yeah, we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow. It's okay. I think it's very easy to I would say seven. It's hard to miss it. Yeah, it's rubber, made of rubber, I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control. Yeah. But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material. So maybe we can put a six. Six is okay? Yeah. Tadada. We have to sum up everything. Six is a good Yeah, the be. Okay, so six is a So it's a good evaluation, I think. It's very promising. Huh. So this prototype is quite nice. Yeah. Okay. So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive, I think. I think the Yeah. So, I think, we can summarise. So we have seen the prototype. It's very nice according to the work of our two designer. The the the financial aspect were okay. We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well. So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting. So the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is okay, so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party. I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff. Okay so congratulation. Nice product. Yeah. I think it was a good collaboration uh. Aspect. Sorry? I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well. All it depends on who watch this meeting. We don't know. Okay, so good guys, so see you for next uh successful project.
@highlight
So we are here for the detailed design meeting .
@highlight
I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .
@highlight
I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual .
@highlight
We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product .
@highlight
Then we will uh evaluate the product .
@highlight
And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .
@highlight
let's start with the cost aspect I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it uh to feel spongy , and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera .
@highlight
And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros .
@highlight
which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .
@highlight
for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .
@highlight
I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings .
@highlight
we have uh six points .
@highlight
we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , I have a scale of uh seven points .
@highlight
I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point .
@highlight
And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .
@highlight
fancy look and feel , what do you think ?
@highlight
between o one and seven .
@highlight
I give it a I give it a five .
@highlight
So I think it's uh very uh very nice .
@highlight
it's between one and seven ?
@highlight
Seven is the highest uh ?
@highlight
Seven is the I will give a six .
@highlight
I will give a a five .
@highlight
Maybe we all have to agree on a common uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or we can choose what we want .
@highlight
let's say that seven is the best .
@highlight
do note the grade we have five , six for me , How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?
@highlight
I think six , it's a good uh So it will have five point five average .
@highlight
after , the technological aspect ?
@highlight
we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .
@highlight
We also have the rubber material , I think I would give a five .
@highlight
It's four .
@highlight
A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .
@highlight
are we including the voice in the end or not ?
@highlight
Huh ?
@highlight
No .
@highlight
Yeah , four .
@highlight
Four , yeah , let's put four .
@highlight
Very easy to use .
@highlight
Do you think it's easy to use ?
@highlight
I give a seven , I think .
@highlight
Mm , six for me also .
@highlight
six point five .
@highlight
Is it fashion ?
@highlight
its its f its fruit fruit shape .
@highlight
I would say seven .
@highlight
Yeah it's fashion , we can we can put a seven here .
@highlight
Easy to find .
@highlight
I think you can't miss it .
@highlight
I think it's cool .
@highlight
We have the lightning , So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , I would say seven .
@highlight
Is it is it robust ?
@highlight
it's rubber , made of rubber , the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material .
@highlight
So maybe we can put a six .
@highlight
Everybody is okay , six .
@highlight
We have to sum up everything .
@highlight
Six is a good Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , I think .
@highlight
So it's a good evaluation , I think .
@highlight
We have a good price So this prototype is quite nice .
@highlight
So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .
@highlight
The the the financial aspect were okay .
@highlight
we have seen the prototype .
@highlight
It's very nice according to the work of our two designer .
@highlight
We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit .
@highlight
The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
@highlight
the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne Congratulations to the team .
@highlight
Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .
@highlight
I think it was a good collaboration uh .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

IS1003b.json,"Mm-hmm. Marketing Expert. Mm. Okay. Yeah. No sure. Uh it's David Jordan. Course. Mm-hmm. No, no. Uh this one doesn't want to be moved, I think. So, I dunno, it's maybe difficult to have both, I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then Yeah. Oh it should okay, yeah. The user should know. Yeah, that's gonna be the trick. Okay. So that's the point. Mm. True. Okay. What the cost is? Twelve, twelve a half. That might just So. Okay. What's the average price of this technology then? But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a I don't think well, yeah, I don't think he would, but in a sense The wire? Yeah. True. Uh that's my job. That's the Now the Yeah. Well that's actually one of the point, yeah? True. This you will see in my presentation then. Yeah. Which is participant four. So just trying to answer all the questions, if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh. We've made a study, so could you go to next slide. Sorry for the functional recurrence. So that's the standard method for marketing, okay. We had one hundred subjects, um, we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire, um, and see what was okay or not for them. Okay. So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered. Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly, okay, so that's Yeah, the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job, David, maybe. Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. So this is where we could have uh yeah, good market, I guess, if people are ready to pay more. So it's it's interesting information, I think. And then um yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. So we should change this as well. And uh users are actually zapping a lot, so they're using the device intensively, that's something to take into account as well. And um, you know, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. And uh this is one of the main point for me. But I'll come back to it later. 'Kay. Could you go next slide? Uh, so as you said uh, remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. So this is from the experiments we've done, so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user, I think. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users. R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times, then you get injured. Okay? So, those numbers are less important then the previous one, but still it has to be taken to count. So last slide. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent, okay. And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons, this would definitely be a good way of selling more. Okay. So Yeah, remember the user is not happy to read the manual. It's Yeah. Yeah, this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step, yeah. Specially distribution, yeah. Uh Yeah, but this is what we would ask to the users, so. Yeah. Yeah, remember it's twelve Euros. Hmm. Yeah, it's done, just yeah. If we would if we could remember like, not too many buttons and make it look fancy, I think it would make it. So. Lame, or Mm-hmm Yeah. Mm-hmm. So has to be yellow. I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway. It's maybe more in browsing. Yeah. Hm-mm. Mm-hmm. Min Yeah. Regarding the first line, what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext. And that's it. It's already changed for Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer. Yep. Okay. Yeah.
Industrial Design. One one. Three three, it's three sorry. In one, sorry. So you didn't save it maybe. Alright, so David Jordan? Mm-hmm. Too great for email then. Yeah. To merge the two system huh. Mm yep. But But this is Yeah. Yeah you maybe you have some international standards, where you know, if you can use one is the other are or almost the same, so the sign. Yeah, yeah. For example, I dunno here, escape, you know, you have escape in computers you have, so if you see escape, you know that it should be the same. So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international, you know that So. Yeah. So. Yeah, but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright. That's your job It you Okay, okay. Participant two. Yeah. The rationale must be design, or So we can move to the next slide. As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. So the re basically the remote control will be, you know, infrared control, so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device, like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_. So, this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know, so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know, so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than, you know For the cheap price we have, for the cheap price we want to I think it's cheaper than laser, so. Yeah, I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see. Yeah. You can move to the next slide, so. So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside. You can go to the next slide. I have some kind of pictures you know, here. You have the b the bulb, it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important, so. This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device. Look. But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and. So and the next slide, it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know, it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both, but you know, I at my side prefer a wireless. Okay, so if you have some question I didn't answer? Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost, I dunno, around eight Euros, so. Or at least you know, the You'd yes, you can. It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know, put some energy inside, so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise, so. We can think that you know, with the wire, you know, without a wire. We can have both also. Yeah, but some pa I always want to have you know, sometime I want to have wire because you know. Uh, I don't think it will be too much. Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical, so. Okay, yeah. Yeah but, it should be an agreement, you know, because even if you can think of the wireless, it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer, but you know. If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have, if you want to use, so it can be good to have a wireless, it it is a question. Right, so. Okay. Mm-hmm. The look, how it look like. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The manuals. With a Look fancy. This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people, maybe the the marketing people. I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, hmm. Yep. So. Yellow. For cheap remote control, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet, so. This is Yeah, but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web. Okay. It's pop I don't think it's popular, so that's the problem so. You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage, so if people don't have the technology. Yellow? Do you think that people like the colour yellow? I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Yeah, so. Doesn't need to be completely yellow, but just mm. But I dunno, but why, nobody's a threat to me. Industrial Designer, yeah. Component component, yeah. Good. Okay Okay, that's clear.
So, I will open our functional design meeting. So, I will play role of the secretary. As also Program Ma Manager. So, we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer and um What's your talk? Marketing Experts. And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements, the decision on the remote control functions, and we will close the meetings after. Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer. Um, so you're participant two? No you're No, I'm participant one. Okay, never mind. 'Kay, did you save your presentation? Isn't that technical functions? Name's Jordan. So so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation. Uh. Mm. So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful. So powerful, many functions and very easy to use. You mean this one? Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control, I suppose. Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that? Yeah um such as maybe the Go on, go back and So, you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use. Okay. So, next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things. So you you're Um. Okay. So, Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer. Okay. Mm-hmm. So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology? Yeah. Do y you know the requirements for the remote control? Twelve, nearly thirteen, yeah. The cost Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. What is this? Okay. Okay. Okay. So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno, I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah, but Yeah but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? I'm just asking you. Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Okay. Yeah, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem. As it's yeah. I think it's more your problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not. Okay, I'm sorry. So So just think of um the usability. Yeah. Just think of the problem. If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television, yeah. So I will let you to do your presentation, so. You mean the loo the look, the outside? Okay. Mm-hmm. What is R_S_I_? Ah um okay. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Sure? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. Yeah, I think the Yeah, but it has to be intuitive. Yeah, okay. Okay, but Yeah, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control. If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more. Yeah, it will cost little bit more. And also f Yeah, but as soon as you speak about options, it means that the price increases, and we don't really want the price to be too too high, because we wanna be able to produce it. So, we want something fancy, as uh previously said, Florent, something very easy to use, powerful and also as uh it's written here, seventy five percent of users, they zap lot, so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot. And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control, they want to zap between channels on T_V_. So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members. So, is it okay for your presentation? Nothing else to to add? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm so So, I had some new information about the product requirements, so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking, in your designing of the remote control. So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, as it's something that's It's is uh No yeah, because now everybody has internet at home, so it's better to use internet then teletext. So, you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control, and also the remote control will only be used for television, so for y for you your designing, you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that. It's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder and all the others, it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that. We really want to focus on the remote control for the television. Is it okay? So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it, to have very powerful and easy. And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan. I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product. So you will have to use the colour of the product, of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah. As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use. Require lot of requirements, but Yeah. Yeah. But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches. Maybe not, but mayb So. So everybody is okay with the new requirements? I think it has to be yellow. Yeah. Maybe you can change the colour, but the image of the society has to be recognised. Why you go It has to be fashion. So you have to Yeah. It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society. Just when you enter you say oh, oh, it's real reaction. Think it's a re reaction remote control, so. And also it has to be attractive, of course, because if you want to sale to sell the remote control. It's okay? Yeah. Yeah. I think it would be simpler. Okay. So I will close the meeting, um just after that we'll have lunch break. And you will have in thirty minutes individual work. Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah, and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept. And Florent to work my subject. And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. It's okay? I think the um session is closed. And by the way, Mister David Jordan, please record your presentations in your own folder. Not in mine. Should be better.
Okay. Okay. No no no. One. I I think I'm a. In one. It's mine. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay, so. The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control. Uh I I will focus on user interface design. Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over, I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um, let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide. So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation. Uh With sophisticated functions, but with very yeah powerful. Yes. Yep. Yeah. But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. Yeah, that's my job. That's my job. It's not the easiest I've got to. Yep. Powerful and easy to use. Yeah, that's the point. So what, the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Wireless remote control. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Design a wireless remote control. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. So lets you then you have less buttons. But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu, so you can well for example Yeah, I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions. Then you you put the switch button, then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder. So there's a different functions, but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder. So we can has less buttons. But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy, not funny. Because different people have a different opinion about fancy. You know. Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people, but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples, so. Yeah, personalised colour. Because you know Yeah, because maybe some people prefer a red remote control, some people prefer black remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options, so user can select which colour they prefer, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. But there's balance between function and the cost. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And cheap. A low cost. Yeah, there's that box in uh o of it. A pi There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. Ok It's It's not so uh popular now. Mm. Global, okay. So I I so As as for the colour, what what do you think? Yellow? T_V_ remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay.
@highlight
I will open our functional design meeting .
@highlight
we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
@highlight
Um , so you're participant two ?
@highlight
did you save your presentation ?
@highlight
One one .
@highlight
I'm participant one .
@highlight
Three Isn't that technical functions ?
@highlight
it's David Jordan .
@highlight
Course .
@highlight
The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
@highlight
remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
@highlight
A very good example is Google .
@highlight
So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .
@highlight
So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
@highlight
With sophisticated functions , and very easy to use .
@highlight
it's maybe difficult to have both , I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it .
@highlight
but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .
@highlight
As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
@highlight
I propose a nifra infrared base I think it's cheaper than laser , so .
@highlight
what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , I have some kind of pictures and you have the other subcomponent There's a wire with remote control ?
@highlight
I think it should be wire wireless re remote con and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .
@highlight
So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea .
@highlight
maybe it will be cheaper I dunno but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?
@highlight
Do you think it will be cheaper ?
@highlight
Could you answer please ?
@highlight
Have to think about the question , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .
@highlight
Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
@highlight
I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , So just trying to answer all the questions , We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , Yeah , the the look is is bad for them Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .
@highlight
And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on .
@highlight
And uh users are actually zapping a lot , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
@highlight
remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
@highlight
Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .
@highlight
And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .
@highlight
R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .
@highlight
Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .
@highlight
If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?
@highlight
Yeah , I think possible .
@highlight
Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button .
@highlight
but do you think it will be easy to use ?
@highlight
Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
@highlight
you you can have a switch menu , but it has to be intuitive .
@highlight
For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .
@highlight
But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny .
@highlight
Because different people have a different opinion about fancy .
@highlight
You know .
@highlight
I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
@highlight
Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
@highlight
new information about the product requirements , the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , because so it's better to use internet then teletext .
@highlight
and also the remote control will only be used for television , you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .
@highlight
So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
@highlight
which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
@highlight
So has to be yellow .
@highlight
As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control .
@highlight
Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
@highlight
Require lot of requirements , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
@highlight
There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .
@highlight
I don't think it's popular , I think it has to be yellow .
@highlight
I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ .
@highlight
Or should be .
@highlight
Doesn't need to be completely yellow , I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break .
@highlight

IS1004c.json,"Okay? Good afternoon. Hope you have good lunch. Oh. Nice. And you? Okay. So today is um our third meeting. It will be about the conceptual design uh. If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings um. We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs. So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today. Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point. So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us. So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts? So marketing. So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere? So you're four? Which is trend watch. Okay. Mr Marketing Experts. So Mm-hmm. Next slide? Yeah. Okay. Mm. Drawings of bananas. Uh-huh. Well so this is in the next slide certainly. It's not? So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_. Apple for channel one. Okay. That's a question. Maybe too long. A banana. Okay. Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also. Well, you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not. So So you you you suggest to go f Okay. S so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons. Okay good. So maybe you can go ahead? Okay. Thanks. Um. Okay, I'll give the floor. So you are User Interface guy. So you're three? And it's this one. Go for it. I there's something that I unclear really understanding. Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords? And it's just to, it's just to playback something? Yeah yeah. So this is not s really to do to to do control. Yeah. This is just more like a poi pois yeah. Yeah yeah. So it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view. Okay. Yeah yeah. So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology, bringing it to the remote control and using it. So this is out of discussion. So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control No this is mm banana-bando, yeah. Uh then it could be cool yeah. Okay. Okay. It doesn't look like a banana at all. Yeah. But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to Yeah. Mm. It's enough. Switch on. Yeah. Okay. So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing. I think that No we can we can't use that. We can't use that to to comman co communicate, it's just a thing No. Yeah. Yeah. A good good good thing. You want to g to move to your slides? You're finished? Yeah I think so. Mm-hmm. Mm. Exactly yeah. Oh, good idea. Very good. Okay, let's move on. So you're two? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be Yeah but the components inside. Yeah. Very too expensive to do. And also uh Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood. Well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah? Yes it is. Yeah? Pumpkin. Green. Um um um, yes I see. Pep pepperoni. Poivron. Uh pepper. But um they do d Yeah. Yeah. It's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun? You think that young people that are Yeah. More than a banana? Yeah. It's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic, it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls. Okay let's move on. So time is running, let's move on. Okay. S objects. Crazy objects. Okay. Okay, good. Bu it's it's. You s you you thing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You think that yellow it's kitsch. If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana. O otherwise Roughly. Yeah. Okay. Let's move on. Uh uh yeah. Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype. Go for it. Well no, not not you, you can finish your slides before Mm okay. Okay. That's all? Okay, so mm so well done for the presentations. So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do. So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels, um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device, I do I don't remember you call it? Basis station, yeah. Uh so um so we're going for a stylish banana shape. Yeah, right. We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing. If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact, it's better. So ti time is running, we have to we have to we have to to move forward. So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea. Yeah. So we have this. We have a a basis um, how do you call it? A base station. We'll have a base station extra uh on the side. Yeah. Uh, we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping. We need b R_F_ to beep. So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis. Basis station, thank you. Can you go quickly please? Okay. So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button. Yeah, on the th yeah, maybe here. And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance. And and you have two wheels. Okay right. Good. So no L_C_D_. Okay great. Um. Very good. Yeah. Oh, just the switch, no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_. Uh so you On the side. Twenty five. Yeah. So. Well. No. Time is running, we have to close the meeting in a few minutes. So, okay, the next step, you can come back to your seat. The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh to building a prototype, based on this, okay? So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things. You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface, in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype. Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation. Okay? It's too difficult. It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype, so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it. Yeah, maybe, for the n if if if it it works well, we'll go for uh an orange one. Yeah yeah, honour the fruit. Okay. Thanks very much. We'll see n next meeting. Bye. Thank you.
Hi. Uh, yes, I had something similar but non-vegetarian. Yeah. What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy? What you mean clothe No, I missed that one. Oh, they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on, okay. So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana, just maybe Okay and So which fruit are you thinking of? Oh, so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit, or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant. But okay, I'm not, I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though, maybe just to fashion gurus, like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner, but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a, an orange is. To fruit? But is it uh is fruit cool? Is fruit cool? Well I guess, you know, Apple has the iPod so, imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product, doesn't mean fruit is cool. Okay, but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know, you don't wanna pear or a watermelon. Well, probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of, a cucumber. I dunno. Maybe. Too green. So, but I mean you also have to you have to also have, fit r all the buttons and you know. It's, it The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons, they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build. Yeah. Well, this is Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay. So. S next uh slide. Okay. So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit, um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control. It's no, what it is, it's it's very It has a has a microphone, has a speaker, it's got a little chip and it allows you t Well, it's a sample sensor sample speaker. Sample sensor sample speaker. It means that it can recognize, it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that. But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase. So, I mean, you know, I guess you could build that in, you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control. But basically the thing is, we have this technology available in-house. So, um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components, so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done. Whilst you know, some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it, It's it it's no, well, it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords, but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase. You train it for a certain uh, for a certain phrase, you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is, you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning, how would you like your coffee? Yeah. So actually that was a bad example, 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response, so. Only, like, only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing, but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh Completely pointless yeah. Yeah. Yeah, unless you know, you like having conversation with your remote control. Well yeah, that's the thing, if you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination, you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen, that whole thing, not just the word channel and the word fifteen, it doesn't have that kind of logic in it. So Yeah, that would be some development work. Yeah. Banana-mando. Banana-man I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though, I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine, so Um, yeah. So if we can just move on to the next slide, I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control Well, you see, I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus, um, so at the moment it's more of a box focus. Yeah, well, this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes. But um, I've just indicated here, we could have actually two scroll wheels, 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of, you know, I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing, so. But I think it's important, you know, to have two scroll wheels because, you know, you want one for for the channel, but you also want one for for the volume, because it's it's the volume i it's, you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response, so. But um, I've also included this turbo button because I think, you know, every design should have a turbo button, and well so this is you know, a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television, the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll, so you know, the th the person might want to have a uh Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them, in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then, you know, displays that station. Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it, even if it lags behind what they're doing. Yeah, so with this turbo button you can, say, skip over t channels if uh, you know, if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know, it's um, you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever. So yeah, that's um, those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote, but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need, um. You know, i it could be, you know, if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device, I mean, we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very, if it's gonna be a banana, you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality, it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote, but if they have these scroll wheels, so, um you know, what other buttons do we want? I mean we could have well, I guess you need an on and off switch, but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe, you know, it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing. That's why you're a marketing guru. Well, that's the thing, as have we decided that we can only spend, uh, twenty five Euro? Well not spend, but you know, charge twenty five Euro. But then you have to have a template for every channel, for a hundred channels, you have to be able to to recognize Mm. Well, I f I think it's probably more than, than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine, you know, to say hello in the morning. Well that's its current application, I would presume that it's kind of, they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so. But uh Well I just I just made the point, I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is, you know, even if we can do it, I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment. But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting, you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know, a base station that can control other things as well. It might be useful to have some kind of base station, even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping, you know, this is a way of finding the remote. Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping It's speech It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of, not really speech recognition, but kind of pattern matching, yeah yeah. I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy. So, just one second, when you say double curve, what do you actually mean? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the, on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure Okay, but like, kind of convex or concave? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Although, you know, wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option, if you take like, nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some, some varnish on. Well it depends, I mean, you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken, it's the inside. Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user. And I mean you could also, you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well. That's true, but are we set on the banana idea? It's like a pumpkin or Green. What does it taste like? Ah yeah, is it what's it in French? Yeah, okay, so capsicum or pepper. Yeah. I don't know, it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me, like like with a banana you can have Well But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that, but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and So is that, when you say speaker support, you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of Okay, but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way, or is just the the signal? Okay. Okay. So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana? Okay. Yeah, but the speaker, if the speaker is actually on the chip, then if it's too far away from the the casing, or if the casing is too thick, then you may not hear the the speaker. Yeah. Yeah. So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside. Although, if It depends, if we like, if we are concentrating on like a fruit design, then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit, you know, like a different fruit for each device. Cause that, you know, that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type. Well, you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place. Like a power fruit. Yeah. Well I think that's a pretty handy feature. I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station, even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries, you know. So Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote. Okay. I'm just wondering actually, 'cause, you know, I this whole fruit thing with the banana, it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche, like only a few people would really want a banana, but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana? You know, rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana, you could make it kind of silver. And um, you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch. For better want of a better word you know? Well, you know, I don I don't know how many peop Well they Yeah, like this colour this colour Maybe, you know, maybe like still in the shape of a banana. No, exactly. Exactly. Um, but you know, just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of, you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape. I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of, you know, twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so, I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor. So you know, so if you have like Okay, so So okay, so I guess we need, you know, something that can fit a banana shaped object. Okay, so it's uh Yeah. Alright, so we need uh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device, so you have Yes. Yeah, so you have the thumb kind of here. So yeah, you need one one here and one on on the other side, so you got volume an and channel. And, uh No L_C_D_. Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well. Yeah. Yeah. Where? Okay. Well, I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place, you know. Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um Yeah, how many of these did we wanna sell? I can't remember, what was Yeah, but how many units did we need to to sell? Four point four million. That's a lot of fruit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh. That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando. Okay. Yep. We have to go design the prototype.
Okay,. Yep. Four, yeah. Yeah that's me. Uh. Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users. Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Well wha what I found um can you Yeah. Thank you. What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device. After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking, but the most what they what they find more more interesting, more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel. So now more more cool aspect, ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things, a device which is pleasant to to watch, to see. Uh also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes, furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables. And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy. Spongy means eponge? So maybe we should we should think in in this direction, so Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan? Yeah, I I didn't miss an I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit, there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes. No no, not not yet, not yet. Yeah, yeah. So te textu textures, yeah. Yeah. Vegetable textures and all this kind. Uh yeah, yeah. Uh no no, it's not. It's And Um. I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit, but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable, some kind of instead of vegetable, some natur mm uh natural object or something. But yeah it it depends on the Yeah maybe the shape the shape No, not n not not too much focus, not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different. So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend but For instance, yeah. African or as an elephant? Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing. I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control. What? What? Yeah? Uh Is the new trend of the No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some Yeah. Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use? Or m Maybe. Um Yeah. Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros? I think Well, according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation, so, I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection, you need more things, it's not just buying a new control re remote, you need buying control remote, buying uh more things. It's not so simple. For instance, yeah. Yeah for for for given an an example yeah. Yeah no, it's what I already said. Yeah but you can u Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay, channel fifty, channel twenty? M Mando. Banana-mando yeah. Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit. Yeah. What's a turbo button? It con it controls the speed? Yeah. So sounds crazy. I like crazy ideas. Yeah, of course. I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so. You we can? We can't. Yeah, but we can say channel twenty five. No? It's not a lot one hundred templates, it's not Ah, it's designed for a cof okay. Is it design for a coffee machine? Okay. Yeah. Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can Yeah. Yeah. Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy. Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh This it's not a fruit it's a vegetable. Green. And you put in the salad. Um Oui c'est ca Pepper. And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No, I mean in a I'm sure it's fun. But banana is not so handy, I think that's handier. Yeah you're right. I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits. No but I think just one fruit to control everything. A power fr a power M a Mando, a Supermando fruit. Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control. So you you have to buy two things, the banana and the basis station. Yeah. Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget. Yeah. No, I I Maybe li like that. What about what about this shape? More or less. Yeah, but how many buttons do we need? What a What about Four millions? What about a I wo what about adding the this word spotting, keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down? It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot, just a few five words. Okay. Plus plus, okay. Maybe objective banana? Thank you.
Afternoon. Yeah, we had falafel. Mm-hmm. Spongy means it it's like sp But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote? Mm-hmm. Means buttons are in the shape of fruits, buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something, apple, banana, something like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That we can discuss afterwards. Banana. Mm-hmm. I don't th it will be rolling a lot. But it's just a speaker right? It's not a microphone. Mm-hmm. Actually I'm not reading microphone there, so that's why you can all have conversation, it just to speak to you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. In-house. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah okay, let's go ahead. Stable thing, that's right. To have, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Communicate. It's one way. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right, yeah. So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing, something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's right. That's right. So this is going to be about the component design. So first thing is we need power source for the remote control. So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies, one is the usual batteries which are there, they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells, when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind. Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces, there should be some flexibility in t Yeah. So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve. The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve. Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them. Double curve is, you have curves on both the sides if I'm right. So it's symmetrical kind of thing, whatever it is. So, it could be curve, so it could be convex, conve concave, depending on what what we want. So there are flats, there are single curve and there are double curves. These are the three things, and there are different materials, with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve. So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood, titanium and all those things, but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one, it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's Wooden cases Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Is it an e apple which has Banana is more handier as compared to this I think, and to capsicum. Okay, so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated, just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection, volume control and teletext browsing. These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that. Yeah, we can go to the next slide. Then uh there are different kind of chips, one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip. So we can have regular chip for control. Pricing is a factor for us, that's why we'll go for the regular chip. And uh regular chip supports speaker support, so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced. It could be a beep kind of thing. Yes, yes, that's right, it's it's onto the chip, most most probably, not not hundred per cent sure about that. That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined. It should be whatever will be the case, the chip is always going to be sitting inside. Mm-hmm. Uh, so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better. As or as hearing is concerned, we can have some gap at some place, so that That's right. Okay. Yeah. So these these were the component selection and these things. We can go to the next slide. And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web, that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control, so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_, because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything, so with this additional little, we might be having slightly better market for us. Mm. Of fruits. Mm-hmm. Remotes objects, okay. And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote. So you're having a basis station. Okay. Your usually your remote sits on that. So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries. Now let's say Basis station is with the thing. It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there. So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries, they're rechargeable batteries, so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost. So you're having the basis station and there is a button, if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is. Uh Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh this is basis station is nothing more, just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits. That's right. But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems. So component cost is going to be the least. Anyway, we are not using really advanced technology, L_C_D_ has already been ruled out, A_S_R_ has been ruled out. So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly. And Mm-hmm. A yeah, otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then. It's neither a banana nor a And uh going to the last slide. Okay. Okay. Okay, so. Anyway, users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes. So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody. That's it. Yep. Mm-hmm. That's right. The basis station. That's right. There's less space on this to put with the buttons. Uh what about a The base station. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's right, yeah, we need that, yeah. Basis station. Yeah, yeah. Turbo button. Okay. Uh for the remote? Remotes don't have power on off switch. Okay. S no, that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already, yeah. Means on the remote. Because remote is going to have both the interfaces, scroll as well as buttons. They are not going to cost you much, everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this. Oh, yeah. That's that's another issue which I didn't think of. But you know our targets are very high, means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make. Twenty five. Twelve point five is the profit on one. Uh forty th four. Point point four million? Point four million. In the market. Mm-hmm. For the future prototypes. So meeting's over? Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. The problem is after all this meeting there is
@highlight
So today is um our third meeting .
@highlight
It will be about the conceptual design uh .
@highlight
um .
@highlight
We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs .
@highlight
Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
@highlight
So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform I investigate deeper the preference of the users .
@highlight
What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device .
@highlight
After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .
@highlight
So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
@highlight
all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .
@highlight
And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy .
@highlight
What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ?
@highlight
I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .
@highlight
So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , Vegetable textures and all this kind .
@highlight
So I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .
@highlight
or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .
@highlight
I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , Is fruit cool ?
@highlight
Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , a cucumber .
@highlight
Maybe too long .
@highlight
and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .
@highlight
and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ?
@highlight
you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons .
@highlight
Okay .
@highlight
So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , So you are User Interface guy .
@highlight
It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .
@highlight
I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .
@highlight
but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .
@highlight
Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?
@highlight
it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase .
@highlight
So this is not s really to do to to do control .
@highlight
It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view .
@highlight
So this is out of discussion .
@highlight
I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um .
@highlight
it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana well , I guess you need an on and off switch , but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .
@highlight
I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .
@highlight
No we can we can't use that .
@highlight
Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .
@highlight
I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment .
@highlight
It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .
@highlight
So this is going to be about the component design .
@highlight
So first thing is we need power source for the remote control .
@highlight
So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind .
@highlight
Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .
@highlight
and then it should be double curve .
@highlight
The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve .
@highlight
with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve .
@highlight
but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .
@highlight
but are we set on the banana idea ?
@highlight
the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy .
@highlight
Yes it is .
@highlight
Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .
@highlight
Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .
@highlight
So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?
@highlight
Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .
@highlight
or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .
@highlight
So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is .
@highlight
Uh I think that's a pretty handy feature .
@highlight
Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget .
@highlight
basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits .
@highlight
L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out .
@highlight
I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ?
@highlight
You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver .
@highlight
If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .
@highlight
maybe like still in the shape of a banana .
@highlight
Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .
@highlight
So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do .
@highlight
so we're going for a stylish banana shape .
@highlight
We'll have a base station extra uh on the side .
@highlight
Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping .
@highlight
So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .
@highlight
and your tur turbo turbo uh button .
@highlight
Yeah , which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , And and you have two wheels .
@highlight
Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .
@highlight
Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .
@highlight
You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .
@highlight
Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

IS1003d.json,"Your judgement it's is biased. So, we are So let's go for our detailed design meeting. So I will still play the role of the secretary, and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer, David Jordan, and our Industrial Designer, Baba. So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control, and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost. And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control, we'll evaluate the um production. So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh, sorry. Oops. Looks strange. Okay. Genetically modified mushroom I will say, but keep on speaking. Oh. Maybe, I hope so. Chan Yeah, okay, but don't touch don't destroy your prototype. Everything's mushroom. So we can call our remote control the mushroom. Okay. Oh. Fruits and vegetables. Vegetables. Mushroom is a vegetable. It's vegetable. So th it's something eatable. Next slide. Mm-hmm. In the base. In the basement. In the basement. And where is the solar solar cell? Where is the solar cell? Oh. Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price? Okay, we'll see after. We will have first to so, mister money, what's your opinion according to this remote control? Mm-hmm. Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, and maybe do things like that It would be bet more like a lemon? Yeah. Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple? And you know, you have the finger here, with the buttons? It looks more like a pineapple. Sorry. What's the use for that? And where is the voice recognition? Okay. Okay. Is it better like that? Looks okay, let's say it's a pineapple now. It looks like a now you took it. It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top. Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum? Three, I will say three. Isn't it bitter like that? Feasible? You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an Oh. Okay, and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative? We have tactile buttons. Oh, yeah. Maybe two? Two? I would say two. You agree? It's better like that, isn't it? Okay. Oh, ok I understand. You take take the remote, so and you can turn like that to change the channel? I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on. Oh yeah. Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go Mm-hmm. Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel. But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it. Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting? Seems to be good. Good choice, mister David Jordan. yeah, what's what's this cherry? Okay. Yeah, th you have the vocal commands. On off. Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control. That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah. So three. Do you agree? Three? And what's your opinion? It's not what you said previously. Previously you said that turning this was the fine Fine to coarse. And from ten to ten channels here. Okay. Oh Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out. It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. It's impossible. You need to put it on and turn. Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control. Nobody would take it. So nobody w will lost lose it. S maybe we can change from th Four? Easy to use, four. Gonna say four. Trois. Three. So, th the project is accepted? But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple. If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control. So uh mm mm. Mm. Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation. So as we all agree to accept, under certain conditions, the prototype, we'll have look to the final sh financial view. So we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros. And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it. So, just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet, so so it has the energy source. We have hand dynamo. No, we don't use that. We have battery, right? Kinetic, we don't have it, I suppose, but we have solar cells. Um, how many do y do you need, solar cells? Do you think one would be enough, or such as as number of branches? Three? So, electronic. Single simple chip on print? Just one would be necessary? One? Zero for the others. And sample sensor, sample speaker. One? As we have voice recognition, I think. So the case. Okay, just keep on going, just to have an idea. Well uh yeah, but what what about case? Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved. I think it's more like double curved. One? Uh wood? Uh do we need special colour? Y maybe, two? We have two special colours. Push button. Okay. Scroll wheel. We don no. It it's more like integrated scor. Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel. So, no button supplements? Okay. Okay we I think we have problem. I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one? Has it changed. Okay. Yeah, but we have you the the voice recognition, no? Okay. Or it would be better. So, do we need special colour? Because we have red. Red and yellow. I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee. Yeah. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. And I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button. So we'll we have only one? And push button. So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button, it's uh Something flat. S uncurved. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah. Mm. Nearly. Maybe don't bat no battery, only solar cells. I think there's a problem with the push push button. We only need maybe just one. Just one. Yeah. So yeah, you will have So one button, and s scroll wheel with push button on it. So So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is twelve fifty e Yeah, but it's under or equal. It's not written. Sometimes it's under or equal. Twelve fifty. Yeah, I think. I think, yeah. But it would i be interesting for our marketing team, to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative, so. So it's easy to use and powerful, as the remote control a has only one button. Easy, powerful. So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product. Yeah. So Now So So did you enjoy your clay modelling? Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control? And for the marketing guy? And new ideas about new products, maybe, wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow. Yes, just lemon. Squared? Ah, the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control. Oh, that's interesting. You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things. Electronic device. Maybe Yeah, maybe la next year it will be insects. Customable T_V_. Ah such yeah. You've already said mobile phones. Yeah, and following Mm. It's interesting, maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr So I think the costs are within the budget. We're just at twelve fifty Euros. So do you think you can celebrate your creation? Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you, mister David Jordan. The thing now is to to sell it. It's maybe a little bit expensive. Maybe what you can do a test. Put it outside, and if bees come, it's really fruit. But don't put sugar in it, it's not working. Yeah, but the colour, I think the colour is more is most important, because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control. Yeah, but we decided to have something yellow and red, for the costs. So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side, the double R_. So we have the logo, we have the colour, and we have the fashion in electronics, so we have the slogan too. Yeah th no, it's the it's the pineapple control remote control. It's a pineapple now, it has changed. It's a pineapple. Pineapple. With cherry on top. Will you buy one? Try to. Okay uh One thing I like is the shape, because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket, on uh in your jacket. I prefer the laser remote control. No. Oh. Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside. Yeah. I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one, and maybe add some features to it after yeah. So Champagne, mister Baba. So Okay, I will close this. Mm. So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product. Final prototype, right. So, thank you very much. Very productive.
'Kay. It's perfect. Where? It's here. Okay. Yeah. 'Kay. I have slides. Ah, that is three. Product prod Yep. Okay. Okay. So, this is our product or prototype. This is made by clay. Yeah. Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red. Yellow is uh our company colour, uh red it's uh is more attractive. So we used two basic colour, yellow and red. And the shape, there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece. It's we call it a mushroom design. It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design. So this is a introduction of our product. Next a mo Okay, yeah, so next slide. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market. Yeah, so it's a fuzzy design, and a unique design. Um, and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection. In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle, so we can turn this ball to t to select channel. So it's quite convenient for user to use it. Yeah, s okay. Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base. Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable, so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it. So it's v Um, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button. You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom, so Yeah, everything's mushroom. Mush Mushroom design, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, th that's why if you put it in the table, be careful, somebody will eat it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, no this our only two slides. Yeah. So we cut it to see. Okay. So where's the battery battery? Base. Here? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, the shape is unique, and the colour So it depend on how d do you define fancy. Uh so, my mush. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Uh, for turn turn the ball. If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel. Uh. Ah, it's embedded, your microphone. Th this th th there's two two functions. This is microphone array Okay. 'Kay. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah, this is microphone array, in fact. There four microphone. So they they they they there's a microphone array. Yeah, yeah. So you can capture voice yeah, you c Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's very easy. You can use this in this way. Yeah. Th this is the base. So you can turn to change the channel. You just tu turn d d Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five. So change. Yeah. Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree. So you got how many degree you you it No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn, then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it. I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change. There's uh also a number, you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also you can, if you i You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this. For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this. It's like fine, from coarse to fine. This is coarse, this is fine. So it's coarse to fine design. Yeah. Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel. This is from one channel to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, agree, agree. Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller? I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball. There's two kind of balls, the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale. But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale? Yeah, yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here. Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one. Yeah, yeah. Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this. Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Mm-hmm. I i this is just a base. You can just Yeah. You use your y So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. Okay okay, okay. Four. Okay. Okay. Three? Trois. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The solar cell is too expensive. Mm. Yeah, we have four. Five. No. No no. No no no, it Okay. No. We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh. We have to delete the the sample sensor, I think. Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions, the first version, the basic version. Advanced version we have speak. Plastic is free. Wait. We we can we can we c yellow. How about we change the sale? Ah we have one Okay. Okay. Agree. Cou could we have look Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost? Okay. So let's say Wha what yeah. Which part is the most expensive part? Yeah, I think it's not t t Cheaper. Okay. Yes. Of course. This is my job. Yeah, it's uh it's good, to to create a control instead of a computer. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um Yeah yeah it's flat, yeah the shape is very boring. Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_? So you can you have base, triangle base so you the T_V_ you can Yeah. Yeah. Because the T_V_ you also Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And you can celebrate your leadership. Yeah. Yeah, it's your job. Sell it. Yeah. Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve Twenty five Euros, yeah. Twenty five Euros. No, it's not so expensive. Okay. Okay. Mm. So we have to give a So we have give him give it a cute name. Mush mushroom controller. Pa Pine apple. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Twenty five Euro. Okay. Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so so you need to buy one. Okay. Traditional one? Yeah. So this one and this one. What do you choose? What do you choose? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So buy one. Yeah. Prototype, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thanks.
No not really. Just Crap. Okay. 'Kay, so whe where is the remote control? Yep. What slides? Yeah. Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. I mean there was fruits yeah. Yeah. I don't think it is. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway, so it's fine. No, I mean, yeah yeah. Inspira inspiration is True. But we say uh we sa we said solar. Yeah. I mean, we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design, and first one was uh fancy look and feel. So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale, one being uh no, I think. Uh just let me check. One one being true, and seven being false. Okay. Ouch. So Do we have a fancy look and feel, according to you? But is it Uh I'll agree it's unique, but is it really Yeah I mean, fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look. Yeah. I dunno where the lemon is, but I mean it's not obvious. If I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Yeah. I dunno. Yeah, it's getting Okay. Yeah, that's Wait th that's the second point. First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel. I mean No, the colour is okay, that's fine. I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red. Um if Right. So, from one to seven? No, seven is false and one is true. Three? Okay. Three. Then uh let me The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative. Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single. Mm-hmm. No, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, th that's another really good point. Maybe okay. So using the same scale, two? Okay. Now maybe the most critical one. L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use? Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the Please. Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? Like if you want to go from Yeah but imagine you y Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? How can you go directly to twenty, for example? Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. But I mean if you're fro from two? Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh We're not talking Yeah. Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? So you you count one degree, two degrees, no. I don't think so. Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main And this would be more for browsing, ah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean you're famous. You. Mm. Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah. Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah. Solar. So, which number? So reasonably, is four, is one? So, three. Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me. I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype. I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use, but I don't know. Yeah. So you have yeah. Uh by pushing zero after after the first one. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, if you're changing your mind. Fine to coarse. Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right? This has to stay on the table. Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it Just It's Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point, because with a traditional one you just have one hand. Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah. Yeah. Four. Uh it's even easier to maybe. Ok Mm. So, average? Three? Okay, so Yeah, especially on the easy to use target. Okay. Mm-hmm. No. So we are all already nineteen. Yeah. That's gonna be double curved, yeah. Rather four buttons. Oh no, interface. Yeah, yeah that's special colours, sure. Yeah tha that's wheel. Yeah. I think the price is okay. Um, no. Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells. Yeah. No y i it did change, but just imagine we have Yeah. Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really Yeah. Yeah, if Yeah. Yeah, that's one of the requirement. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. Black then is a regular colour, so. Yeah, one. Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one. Yeah, thi this might be. Close to. Okay, so what's the bottleneck? Double curved. Yeah, but flat Case, what's the ca And then one Euro left. Um. Um So we have one button, one wheel. It's good they're not charging anything for that. Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half. Okay. Okay. Solar cells. Yeah. That's nice argument, but if it's it's still four our of twelve. Yeah. Yeah but we just have one button. Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah. Mm. Uh that's what we've just done. Yeah. Um okay. Well I think we have just have to discuss if I dunno. Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe. 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um. Yeah, but just don't trust too much the trends. 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh. Maybe two years it's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long long life product. T_V_ is more like fifteen years, maybe, so. If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for fifteen years Yeah, yeah. Tha that would that would make it. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. It's party party remote control. Yeah. Uh-huh. Twenty five Euros. Yeah, I think it's It's cheap, yeah. No, I I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know. Yeah. No, the colours are uh it's perfect, yeah. True. Uh yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still. Uh Still that was one of the requirements we had. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend. It's not the trend. Yeah, but just flying saucer, or I would say flying saucer. It's more appropriate, somehow. Mm. Mm. Yeah but that's going to be expensive, you know. We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno. Yeah, afterwards, if if it's a new trend. Okay. We should celebrate. Mm. Yeah. Our final prototype which yeah.
Mm-hmm. So, ready? Sorry, I I um I'm afraid Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything. Okay. Yeah. Uh Yeah, yeah I'm sure. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, centre is yellow and t d To integrate, you know yeah. I don't think I hope nobody will eat it. You know, to integrate the fruit aspect, you know the the in Really? But Fruit and vegetable, so mushroom was a kind of you know uh Mushroom? Oh, uh I'm not sure. We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable, but you know we we integrated them with different colour. I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know. This, you know, very enlighted colours, you know. And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material, so. And so So what we w what I can add is that, you know he talk about what is outside, so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about, you know, the chip, it is a low level chip, and You know, we don't need to k. You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i The battery it is under. It is in th in in the base, yeah. In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so, but it it's might be okay, so. I it might be okay. So Yeah. So, four point three point five, it means it's acceptable. Oops. I think you have nice colours. I don't The sha the bowl shape people like. Is it really fancy? But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing. Do Don't do that, please. I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like, so Yeah. Because i Less button. Yeah, but you don't have any button now. That's uh yeah, is that that's a good idea. So that's great. That's great. I have no idea, so. I have no idea what If it is fancy or not. So we can we can say t The colour, is the colour acceptable? So the shape now. It's too much red? In the basement? I will give I will I'll gi I'll give two or three. Three, it's okay. Three, three. Three is fine for me. What other Is it easy to use? Ye uh Embedded. It's a micro array, okay. Oh yeah, yeah. And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I W Yeah, but I see, you have microphone array embedded. You have That's good. And you have, you know this ki this solar receptor that, you know Yes. Yeah. I think technically it's acceptable, so Yeah. Two, yeah, two. It's it's fine, so. Most Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking. You just need the command. As a principle. I think maybe if you he If you hear some click Yeah, it would Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult. Yeah but y how you need to know I I think something that Yeah. And you you can I think you can if you have a scale, so Yeah, it's a bit difficult. I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah. Yeah. To see uh yeah uh Yeah. And but I'd It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe. Yeah, yeah yeah. That's that's very technologic, so. Yeah. S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the Uh it's k on off, yeah. Yeah, sleeping. To compensate. Yeah. Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. Three f three for me, it's o it's okay. Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean. Will you give four? Five? Yeah, so maybe if Yeah but y you know You just push two button, zero and and one. And that's Are there some buttons? Okay. In fact on a flat place You can Oh ye yes, that's right. Oh my God. yeah maybe, maybe may it's the next prototype, maybe we cou Four. Maybe four, it's okay. I'll put four. Yeah, four it's more reasonable. You can you can erase with this er yeah. Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. So it's nine, nine over three. Oh yeah, it's. It need maybe some wo further work, but it's Yeah, uh s yeah. Might it might be fine. Yeah, b I think Yeah, yeah. That's the finance. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, we have battery. No, um solar cells, yeah. Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah, three, yeah. Three three solar cells. S s simple, simple, yeah. Yeah. Mm. One maybe, yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Is it Is sh it Wooden. Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think. Double curve, yeah, double curve. One, you have. But it's yeah, a a rubber uh Yeah, yeah. Y y yeah, yeah. Five? I think that this will be like a scroll wheel, actually. Y you tu you turn you turn it, so Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Scr L_C_ display, maybe. Interface. It's okay. fine. Yeah, it was stage one, so. So I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe. Because uh it seems that this can be yeah, wood into plastic and it it should be fine. Yeah, red and yellow. Fancy. One. I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons, so we can just, I dunno, try to modify some of them to have yeah. Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah. F some Single curve. Single curve should be fine, so. Oh, what It's it's a bad idea, so. Two? One. That's fine. That's fine. One s one scroll wheel, so And the vocal chord, it's fine. It I th it's fine. It's fine. It's under or equal. It's fine, so It's fine, twelve fifty uh The solar cells, r is i is it? Yeah, to be able to si to sell it. Yeah, with mi It's it is really really uh really very very expensive, though. Maybe if uh okay. Yeah, yeah. It's easy to use. It's very easy to use. No. We've done it with it is under the if it was low, high or so. So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation? Okay, okay, it's fine. Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for. Yep. Okay, okay. Yellow. I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno. It can be an interesting I don't know Yeah, just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon. It's flat, uh Yeah, that's right. It's really boring, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's that would be really interesting, actually. Device devi The fruit? Yeah. Yeah, it's But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after, you know, if the people change their mind you change also the product. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's a yeah, yeah. We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know. Yeah, you customise it every ti so every ti if people change, you just change the appearance, and y y you can keep Yeah, you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons, the fashions uh We int Yeah, T_V_, yeah. A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter, you know, so it's So what i and do w is it Okay. Yeah, the pr at Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object. So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy, so. Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah. Yeah, right, go and sell it. Goo and good luck, so It should be fine. Wh really? It should be it should be fine, you know, actually. S I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good, so actually so It's perfect, and I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ Okay yeah, yeah. That's actually good idea, so It's not a mushroom. It's a pineapple remote controls. Yeah, pineapple remote remote control. Oh, that Oh unid uh unidentified remote control, so That's that's pineapple remote control. I think it's fine. Yeah. Yeah I will try I'll try. I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage Yeah I always lose my Yeah, so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_, so it would be I think I would choose this one because of the colour. It's it's will enlight your house, your home and your T_V_, so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah that would be uh an idea.. Yeah that's that fine. So we can celebrate now. That's our new product. Yes. It's it's fine. It's I like it. Next time. Well, I'll buy one here. Yeah. No? Okay. Okay. Final prototype, yeah, ye yeah. Okay. Okay. S so who is going to take the remote control?
@highlight
we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba .
@highlight
Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red .
@highlight
And the shape , there's two basic shape .
@highlight
It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .
@highlight
So there are several key features of our pr prototype .
@highlight
The first is that it is fuzzy .
@highlight
I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .
@highlight
the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection .
@highlight
The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
@highlight
Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base .
@highlight
So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends .
@highlight
Fruits and vegetables .
@highlight
And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so .
@highlight
the low level chips inside The battery it is under .
@highlight
It is in th in in the base , yeah .
@highlight
In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and Yeah , the shape is unique , Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Looks like more fruit .
@highlight
It looks more like a pineapple .
@highlight
If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .
@highlight
And where is the voice recognition ?
@highlight
Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .
@highlight
First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
@highlight
No , the colour is okay , that's fine .
@highlight
but I would say there is more too much red .
@highlight
Right .
@highlight
So , from one to seven ?
@highlight
Three .
@highlight
let's say it's a pineapple now .
@highlight
The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
@highlight
There four microphone .
@highlight
And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?
@highlight
Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .
@highlight
And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is We have tactile buttons .
@highlight
I see , you have microphone array embedded .
@highlight
I think technically it's acceptable , so I would say two is it easy to use ?
@highlight
Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy .
@highlight
Yeah but this this turning Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
@highlight
and you can turn like that to change the channel ?
@highlight
Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?
@highlight
Oh yeah , that's difficult .
@highlight
That's dif that's difficult .
@highlight
then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
@highlight
It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the I think b but the the vocal command is easy too .
@highlight
So it's coarse to fine design .
@highlight
that's very technologic , so .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
yeah it's a sleeping remote control .
@highlight
Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .
@highlight
W that why we have the solar ti yeah .
@highlight
To compensate .
@highlight
I think it's easier than traditional controller .
@highlight
you have you just turn the turn the ball .
@highlight
it's reasonable three .
@highlight
those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .
@highlight
But this this has to stay on the table , right ?
@highlight
In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand .
@highlight
If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .
@highlight
You know tha that's the weak point , Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
@highlight
Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so .
@highlight
It need maybe some wo further work , but it's Yeah , especially on the easy to use But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .
@highlight
we need to calculate the production cost .
@highlight
As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros .
@highlight
Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ?
@highlight
but we have solar cells .
@highlight
Uh I think in each ball you have three Single simple chip on print ?
@highlight
And sample sensor , sample speaker .
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
One maybe , yeah .
@highlight
So we are all already nineteen .
@highlight
The solar cell is too expensive .
@highlight
There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think .
@highlight
We have two special colours .
@highlight
We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip .
@highlight
Oh .
@highlight
Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .
@highlight
Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
@highlight
I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe .
@highlight
We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .
@highlight
An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button .
@highlight
Double curve .
@highlight
We can transform the double curve into single c yeah .
@highlight
So we have one button , I think there's a problem with the push push button .
@highlight
One s one scroll wheel , so So , yeah .
@highlight
It think we we've done good job , as the cost is It's fine , twelve fifty uh Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .
@highlight
Okay we I think we have problem .
@highlight
I think we s if we keep on adding things Push button .
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
Yeah , we have four .
@highlight
I think it's more like double curved .
@highlight
But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .
@highlight
Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .
@highlight
So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?
@highlight
Yes .
@highlight
Of course .
@highlight
This is my job .
@highlight
Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
@highlight
And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .
@highlight
Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe .
@highlight
'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um .
@highlight
Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ?
@highlight
You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things .
@highlight
Electronic device .
@highlight
'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh .
@highlight
But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
@highlight
We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .
@highlight
So I think the costs are within the budget .
@highlight
do you think you can celebrate your creation ?
@highlight
And you can celebrate your leadership .
@highlight
I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .
@highlight
Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .
@highlight
It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
@highlight
Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .
@highlight
So we have give him give it a cute name .
@highlight
It's a pineapple remote controls .
@highlight
and we have a nearly final product .","```

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Adaptable. Alright, good, so how many actions do we need to implement in it? On off? I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states, yeah you know what I mean, we can just make it uh controlled by a brain, huh? Mm-hmm. Sh sure, sure. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. Mm-hmm. You do this? I usually just change channels. Uh-huh. Go back button is good. I once had it. Mm-hmm. History. Market Expert. Okay. Thank you everybody.
No. Rabbit. You wa Is the white okay. I guess you can. Yeah uh not really. Small cobra. Chris. Mm. Smile fish. Yeah. Yeah, you're Hmm. Yeah, we're to sell two million then. Mm yeah. Yeah, pret Yeah. Ah. Yeah, we have some child lock or something, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's always black or yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah even we can change colours, no? Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah. At least for children like one colour and. And it should be really small and. Huh not so big like yeah. Yeah, not too much buttons and Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Colour, size, sh Yeah, maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess. Yeah yeah, at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. Yeah. Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Mm. S so then it depends you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Too expensive, yeah. Ye yeah. Hmm. I mean it it's like it's like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this, say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah. Mm huh. Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. We can adapt only one switch, suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. Two. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. Dash. Yeah you can yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, the previous button is. Uh, okay. Oh uh. Uh. Yeah. Yeah yeah, what the which channels the viewer Marketing yeah. Thank you.
Wow. Wow. Complex. Huh? A cat. No. Darn. Uh. A what? A r a rabbit, oh oh yeah, where is the carrot? Okay mm-hmm. I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff. My favourite animal is Guess. A human, yay. It's a very complex animal and um yeah. Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous. Ah, a kind of uh snake? Cobra? Exactly. Uh-huh. What about you uh Christa? A fish. A smiling fish. Mm-hmm. So, w whiteboard is working? Good. Next. Yeah, well. Not me. So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control. Okay. 'tis big number. Mm-hmm. Uh yes, we have plenty at home. In fact, my daughter likes l remote controls. To eat? Yeah, mainly, and to break. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ye ye yeah. So she likes uh buttons which make click, so it has to click. It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh So it has to be very robust. Unbreakable, yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh it has to be nice looking, colourful, maybe colourful, because uh nobody has colourful remote control, they're always black, yeah, but this one could be I dunno, purple or b Yeah, yeah. One colour. Yeah, yeah. Oh like the phones, yeah, it could change colours, yeah. Yeah. Good. Should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television, then it's the remote control for the the sound system, or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's Or if we should have a targeted re remote control. So colour, robustness, easy to use, size, yeah, size matters, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. But uh what would be different from this, from the others? I dunno if Yeah, at least the colour would be different. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow, I dunno. Too expensive for twelve Euro? Ah. Mm-hmm. I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user. So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right, so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control, if you if you like. I don't know if it makes sense, but Yeah, for instance, mm. Mm. Maybe, if if it's possible, yeah. Yeah. Three buttons you mean? Ah. Mm-hmm, yeah, sure. Yeah, more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time. Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. Uh no. Because I'm only using three or four channels but And then back to the one I was before, so there's whichever it was. Yeah. Uh uh we had that in in other countries. Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions, that becomes more complex, but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls. Yeah maybe it's a Okay. So what does M_E_ means? M_E_ the user requirements? Or that's uh that's for us? Uh that's me. Oh, of course yeah, the user requirement specifications, uh-huh, yeah. Okay. I'll think of that. So? Meeting's over? Great. Thank you.
So, hello everyone. We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control. I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin. So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan, some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting. So um we want to to do a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy and user friendly. Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design, it's conceptual design, and desail detailed design. and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day. Um, so let's try the whiteboard. Um so any of you who want to go. Wow. A rabbit. A rabbit. You want to go? A human ah. Mm I think you're supposed to, yeah. Hmm. Is that a worm? Or Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm. Smiling fish. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Next. Let's talk about money. So. Yeah, mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control. We aim to do this profit. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum. 'Kay. So any of you have experience in remote controls? That So that could be a great um application. Remote controls children proof. Mm mm-hmm. Okay. So they have to be waterproof maybe? 'Cause they eat she ate it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Colourful, yeah mm. No, that's a good idea. Mm mm-mm. Yeah. No, because you think, why not. Mm-hmm. Good idea. Small also? Don't you think No uh, not too much buttons or mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's Okay. So, I think there's So you you think it's better if small than bigger. No, not too small, yeah. Hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no. Okay. And too expensive. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. So adaptable yeah something yeah. Three option. Um. Mm-hmm. Maybe if it's more, if there is a software inside that ask you three Hmm. If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah. Mm. Yeah. I change channel like this, m uh I want to go to twenty five, and then to ten, uh-huh mm yeah. Also we can be here yeah, that would be cool. Mm yeah. Mm-mm. Okay. So I think we have full of idea. Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do. Um. So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. So. I think that's all. Yeah. See you in thirty minutes.

So that could be a great um application .
@highlight
Remote controls children proof .
@highlight
but mainly it has to be very robust colourful , maybe No , that's a good idea .

And it should be really small and .
@highlight
Small also ?

ES2003c.json,"Alright, yeah. crack on. Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. I think to sum up the last meeting, would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out. Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick, L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck, the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck. Um that pretty much sums up the last one. So we'll just crack on, um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible. Um uh the con today is the concep today. This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um Sorry about this.. And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of, um, can we uh outsource these from elsewhere, um will we have to construct any items ourselves? Yeah, okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then. Um. Which one do y Oh, interface concept? That's you. We've got trend watching, that's you. Components design. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, the kinetic one, we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it. Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power, would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? Do you think? W Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again, you'd say? Um. Um. Curious. Um, I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not, the single curved and double curved, would you be able to give an example? Um could you maybe draw something? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect, it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two. So it might literally just be okay. Alright. Mm. Okay, that was definitely something we can talk about. Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well? Um, do you have any idea so far, like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_, does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount? Or? Well I think compared to say just pressing buttons. if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red, whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip. Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made. If I've not over-stepped. Yeah? Okay, um should I go on, or go back? Well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such. I assume. We have to look into the costs of those. So, sorry. Okay. Okay. Um.. So in the information that you've been supplied, how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks? Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me. Um conventional battery would seem to make sense. Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm I don't know about anybody else, but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward?. Okay. Okay, well um Yeah, well will we move on to user interface, and yeah? Um sorry, as long as were you? Yeah. Okay. Um and d d d interface concept. Yeah. Can I just jump in slightly there? That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate, then. okay. Mm. Okay. Um, yeah. Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well, because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say, I guess. Okay. Excellent, right. Um uh. File open. Trend watching. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs, so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway. Um. Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf, so I don't exactly what cost would be incurred. Um I can see your point about the number keypad, but I've I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels. My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be Mm-hmm. Okay. So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components, um, say something like um lithium ion battery, the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now. Um Looks like we going for a double curved design. Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Um, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? I can see why it looks appealing, but it could be a weak point in um the structure, do you think? That would be a worry of mine. Yeah, we won't add that functionality. However, one interesting point is, I don't know how serious you were there, but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? I dunno. It's an certainly a different colour from your average um That's true. Was there anything in your research Mm-hmm. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced. Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function, and such. Doesn't have to be used very often that's right, yeah. Okay, this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage. I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway. This is the conceptual one. Um. I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here. Um I think we've decided on what, you know, decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such, so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting. Um So for example, um I'll just start at the top, you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to, obviously. Um looking from prototyping of some des description using clay. Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress. Um The user interface design, They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there, whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate, do you think? Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout? Mm-hmm, that's very true. Um. Okay. Um got product evaluation as well. Um. I I think we'd be yeah, no, it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with. Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out, uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar. Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control, what do you think of the look of it? Um I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous. Um the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control, something that's stylish, so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then, they've got a bit of free cash, so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket. Maybe even single, just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow. Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros, I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device. Think that's well within the normal bracket. Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost. U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there, but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system. That one might have to be based on The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice, easy minimal design, normally. Um. It's just for T_V_, but for programming it to use your T_V_, you might hook it up to the P_C_. I I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive. We don't know unless it would make sense to. Mm-hmm. W It would make sense to. I would say to. Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well. We've already had the five minute warning, so. Um. I would say yeah. International would make sense. Um you're gonna look at product evaluation. I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap. Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say. Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay. Uh we'll see how that goes. Um. So um do I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting, would you say? Yeah, I would s that would be my my feeling. We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite Yeah. So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used. Um. Okay. And I think that says it all really. Right. See everybody in a half hour.
Uh uh okay. I'll just Uh I have a presentation I just saved it in the uh the folder. Uh. It's uh Components design.. Alright. So Uh. The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic. Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well, or titanium or even wood. So uh we decide what it's gonna be. Probably plastic. Uh we need the infra-red transmitter. Get that off the shelf. Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it, um could be plastic w or rubber even as well. Um if you go on to the next slide. Uh If you go on to f uh findings, it's like two or three slides down. Right. So, this is what I found we can use. Uh three different types of batteries. Um can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, you know that they use in watches, or else uh a solar powered one. Um. Yeah. Uh. Yeah, I don't think it would. Um. And solar cells, I dunno about that. Uh. We should probably just use conventional batteries. Um, just like in usual remote controls. Um. Yeah. Um. And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. Uh one is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. Um the materials are tha there as you can see, but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved, uh which would be Yeah, and light. Uh, i think so as well, yeah. They make mountain bikes out of that, don't they. So it's really light as well. Um. T yeah. Uh. Well for a curved, well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand. Uh maybe like this, with the uh joy pad here. Joystick here. And maybe um an okay button around here, so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily. Um I don't exactly Double curved. It probably means this is probably double curved. Uh whereas a single curved would be like that. I guess. Or not necessarily. Yeah like that. Whereas this is two curves. Um so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve. Um which obviously it looks better than the single curve, but uh you can't have it in titanium, which is uh a nice material. Uh and for the buttons, um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s. Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use, and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive. So you have to decide, there's trade-offs there. Um if you want the buttons to be oh yeah, if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. But you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days. You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want. You wanna enter just the number of it, if you know it. So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway. Do you think? Yeah. So, depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display. Yep. Yeah i Um Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control. If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does, translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_. Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier. And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons, the rubber buttons, uh to uh get sent to the chip. So that's just how the control works inside. Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use.. Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic. Um and then maybe use single curved uh case. Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily. Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_. Yep I'm finished. Ah, okay. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that. The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. Forgot to say that. Yeah. If you're going with the fruit and veg thing, looks like a banana. F if you wanna design it that way. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. monkey. The U_S_B_ for which? Oh right, okay. But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_, or are we gonna Okay, yeah. they're going with the fashion thing, like the design, spongy rubber. Yeah.
Uh. Cost is Yeah. Yeah. yeah. Titanium, the really strong metal, titanium? Is it not also it's expensive? Two curves. Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_. Is that did I Advanced, like three eight six advance. Okay. Okay, sure. Mm, if we only have twelve Pounds fifty, twelve Euros, not even twelve Pounds. Twelve Euros, what's that, like eight pounds or something like that, nine Pounds? Okay, that's good point. I also have a preference for rubber. Based on my research. digital. Is this the joystick? Okay. Mm. Mm. 'Kay. We go. Okay. So uh to gather my research, two basic methods. We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe, what's what's the new black, you know, as it goes. Next slide please. Uh we found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool. As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot, and if it does do a lot that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, you know. They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction. Technology technical technologically innovative. People want it to be that, but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. So like the interface is really important. And easy to use, it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point. People want it I is it has to be cooler than easy to use, you know, if it has the newest features, even if it's difficult to use, prefer it to have the newest features. And if it's easy to use that's a bonus. The fashion, now this is seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. How that relates to a remote control I don't know. But I I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide. Spongy. I've als I've been saying everything's the new black. Well spongy's the new black as well. So we have the choice between rubber and plastic. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then can I skip the rest? Okay. Okay, so kinda spongy material. So um so my personal opinion? Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative, obviously. But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool, that's that's different, you know, that's everyone has a white remote control, black remote control, you need something cool. Like, titanium is cool but it's expensive. And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control. Um now the fruit and veg options, either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg, so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy. So if we stay away from it, s you know stay away from it, but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit. It could be something like, I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do. So I think cool is the key. Few questions about a spongy remote control. I've never seen one before. I've seen plastic remote controls. I think maybe they were I don't know, back in the day when they first came up with remote controls, they had a reason for it being sturdy, you know. For being strong and sturdy. So um if we want something strong and sturdy, I say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, it doesn't matter, it's spongy material, it's not gonna break, you know. I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable. So how do things fit it? And if we are gonna use spongy, we can say it's long lasting, you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that, so. So just to summarise, people want stuff that's cool, that's that looks like it's cool, and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg. We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it. People like spongy material. If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is, and how we can further promote that idea. And also, this was this year. So, things change all the time, every year you know they they always talk about this year, this is the new black. Well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff. 'Kay. That's me. That's a good point. You can incorporate names into the menu. Okay. Even news, music. Like they do on uh sky digital kinda. Yeah.. Okay. Course not. Sure, yeah. Sure. The noise for when you lose the banana, um f yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep beep. Y you know, you lose the monkey the banana, y you lose the banana, you press a button, and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. S oh, I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s, you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature, I I don't know. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's because televisions, they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it. Okay. Is it is it actually a book of names to digits, or is it like a few pages? I was just thinking, if we were to store this information, some type of mapping. This person probably need to use this feature like once, you know, when you first buy the remote control, or whenever they buy a new television, so once every s Yeah, and it's Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others. How can t product evaluation, doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. Oh, that's the okay, sure sure sure. Mm-hmm. Okay, sure. At this stage we still have no no target audience or 'Kay. And it's stylish. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yep. Okay. Programmable memory as well. For the remote control. We've w definitely talking some type of Different. But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something. Well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed, you know, once you turn off the power. Yeah. Different languages, uh different skins and stuff like that. Sure. I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff, that does open it is supposed to be international, right? So. It would make sense if you could Okay. Yeah. The fruit and veg. This one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. I mean we are trying to promote a remote control, but we wanna keep the company brand as well, so. I think so too. Sa
Yeah, that's me. Mm. There's also a watch moves around a great deal more. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail.. Mm. Yep. Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time. Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all. I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes, uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand. Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on, um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. Um so uh next slide, if you please. Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick, two function buttons and the L_C_D_, just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum. I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels, so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable, whatever, you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels, and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player. And or um box. So it's not I'm not really excessively concerned about that. You must have two two modes, basic mode, where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels, up down for volume, um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions. Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. Um, so you Mm-hmm. Yes, absolutely. Um, basi basically what I basically what the what be having um, I would say, the the whole thing articulated at two points, so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh The joystick would be in the right place. And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be, you know, soft to touch and can be moved around all nice. Um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide. Okay. Yeah, 'kay basically um I can add pretty pictures to this. The um Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position, um hol uh holding the remote, the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb. Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users. So. You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness. You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part, one for the four finger, one for the middle finger. Um, and that Th this part here is the joystick. This would be the actual grip. Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well. That would be probably the bulkiest part. And you then have, at the uh at the bottom, the L_C_D_, and this would need to be articulated as well. And basically I'd want this to rest here, right at the base of the wrist. So it would fit just nicely in the hand. And again, this part could be rotated, so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user. Um So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button. And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes. Um now programming it actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control. Programming them can be a right pain. So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface. And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers. Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer, uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet. Um. But uh. Yeah. That's that's my idea. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, actually if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh, you know, what number's the discovery channel or whatever. It's just irritating. But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure, then you can sub-group them. So you Yeah. Yeah, I I would say definitely, I mean I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation. W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip. So Mm. I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness, I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure, you can then incorporate articulation into that. If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic, and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool. I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice, it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control, but uh. Mm-hmm. Make it harder to lose, as well. I th uh I mean if it I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable, though maybe have monkey as default. Um. Mm-hmm. Well basi basically the um for f for uh I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to. It's not simply a matter of frequency. So um usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote, and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one. It's Yeah, that's right. So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that. But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. Yeah. Yeah. Um booklet. Some pages. Yeah. Yeah. But it's a but it's a nuisance. And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it, so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about. If you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance, you might be favourably inclined towards it. Um mm. Mm. Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it, um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made, I would say. Um but then again, the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television, and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate. So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, I mean it's Yeah. Yeah. The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway. Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know, it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device, the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh Mm-hmm. How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels. That sort of thing. Yeah. Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know. Where is the clay? Mm-hmm. Mm. I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing. Bu but um but the spongy idea I like. I like it a lot. I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea, though maybe we could have options for colours as well. and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I was like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button.
@highlight
I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out .
@highlight
Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
@highlight
Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
@highlight
This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic .
@highlight
Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood .
@highlight
we decide what it's gonna be .
@highlight
Probably plastic .
@highlight
Uh we need the infra-red transmitter .
@highlight
Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well .
@highlight
Um three different types of batteries .
@highlight
Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .
@highlight
Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query .
@highlight
Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?
@highlight
And solar cells , I dunno about that .
@highlight
Uh .
@highlight
We should probably just use conventional batteries .
@highlight
Um , just like in usual remote controls .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have .
@highlight
Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved .
@highlight
but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?
@highlight
Double curved .
@highlight
It probably means this is probably double curved .
@highlight
Uh whereas a single curved would be like that .
@highlight
it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive .
@highlight
there's trade-offs there .
@highlight
Um you have to decide , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well .
@highlight
I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days .
@highlight
like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ?
@highlight
Or ?
@highlight
We have to look into the costs of those .
@highlight
Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control .
@highlight
And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip .
@highlight
translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ .
@highlight
in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?
@highlight
Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic .
@highlight
Um and then maybe use single curved uh case .
@highlight
Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail .
@highlight
I also have a preference for rubber .
@highlight
Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all .
@highlight
I wasn't very impressed by them uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today .

@highlight
Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people .
@highlight
That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .
@highlight
And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users .
@highlight
And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well .

@highlight
We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool .
@highlight
And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool .
@highlight
As in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , Technology technical technologically innovative .
@highlight
People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does .
@highlight
like the interface is really important .
@highlight
And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point .
@highlight
The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes .
@highlight
How that relates to a remote control I don't know .
@highlight
Spongy .
@highlight
If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ?
@highlight
The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .
@highlight
kinda spongy material .
@highlight
Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously .
@highlight
But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it .
@highlight
but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit .
@highlight
Few questions about a spongy remote control .
@highlight
I've never seen one before .
@highlight
if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , And also , this was this year .
@highlight
things change all the time , every year Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , Looks like we going for a double curved design .
@highlight
Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that .
@highlight
Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber .
@highlight
Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .
@highlight
there would be basically two points of articulation .
@highlight
W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip .
@highlight
Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ?
@highlight
but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ?
@highlight
If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?
@highlight
Sure , yeah .
@highlight
Make it harder to lose , as well .
@highlight
The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .
@highlight
y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .
@highlight
I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control .
@highlight
Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .
@highlight
e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to .
@highlight
But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .
@highlight
An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay .
@highlight
um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say .
@highlight
Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate .
@highlight
product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype .
@highlight
At this stage we still have no no target audience I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .
@highlight
Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost .
@highlight
U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ .
@highlight
The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive .
@highlight
Um you're gonna look at product evaluation .
@highlight
Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay .
@highlight
they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .
@highlight
I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , though maybe we could have options for colours as well .
@highlight
like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button .
@highlight
So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on .
@highlight
Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used .

Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. Yes, exactly Yes. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different. All the almost all the remotes Yes, exactly. Are different shapes. Yes. Yes. Or a b Should ha A fluorescent signal, yeah. Yes. Yeah. And uh Yes. Then, in that case Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes.
Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui. Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design. Snake. Yeah, of course, using remote control. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Audio player. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Divides us Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, maybe ten I do yeah, colours and al shapes also. Yeah. Yeah of course yeah. Yeah. Yeah, some beep or something like that, so that we can go Yeah. Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is. Yeah, yeah. May not be beep. Beep or uh it's a light, maybe it's a light. Yeah, probably yeah, probably it's a yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course, that didn't I i we can't do it. Yeah, good point. Me yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's functional de yeah, exactly, technical. Yeah. Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design. Yeah, functional design, and you Yeah. Yeah, even I have. Yeah, even I have, I think, yeah. Yeah, so let's see. Hmm. Yeah.
Okay. I think so. Yeah, that's a good plan. And I'm a marketing person. I wanna figure out how to sell them. My name is Eileen. Okay. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay so Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay. Functional, conception and detailed. Maybe we should redesign it. After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that. Okay, I'll see what I can do. See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something. So that it will record okay. Um uh um traditional kitty cat. I've a very fat cat. And it likes to sit like that. Okay. Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay. Okay. Uh, okay. I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged. Profit. Um is fifty mm. Oops. At um twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that. We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things. That's right. Yeah okay, friendly shape, that would help. I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap, because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them. They can't find it. Mm-hmm. So some Uh so, so it's really the beep or, or a light should blink. Mm 'kay. And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay so Okay. So the light sensor would activate the signal. Mm-hmm. But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it. Well, because you're s because you're silly. Because people are silly. I mean it could be on well, i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um, you know, well maybe we have to move along, okay. Mm-hmm. We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price. Mm. Okay, I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting. How about you people? Really? Okay. 'Kay. Alright, well uh Okay, very good.
Okay. Everybody ready? Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is? So maybe we start with you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. And your name is? Okay. Very good. And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today. So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do. Um. Yes y opening, acquaintance, tool training well, the tools are, I think, we already I guess the tool is really our the computer, as far as I can see. Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there. Project plan, that falls under the same heading pretty much. Um, I don't think we have any great discussion at this point. Um. Here is what this thing should be. This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control. Uh should be original, trendy, and, of course, user friendly. So maybe you wanna make some notes of that. Okay? All right. Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. Um. That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with. The same goes for the conceptual design, there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards. Detailed design, same thing basically. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I can't write with this thing. Yes. Yeah, okay. All right? Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal. Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works? So that in case we have to, in the next meeting, present something on the white board. You wanna go Eileen and Whether you without hanging yourself. And remember you have to press so it works. Mm-hmm. Fat, a fat cat. Okay. And you're Francine, right? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels, so that you have a little idea? In No, no. No, that's okay. I don't know, we'll get to that later. Okay. Okay. Here's the project finance uh which, of course, we all have to think about when we design this thing. Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro. Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro, the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro. Mm-hmm. So these are all things, of course, to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost, etcetera. Now, uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control? I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em, right, everyday. And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas? Would you like it to be smaller, bigger, have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that? Small, right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically. Well. It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have. Now, of course, the other thing to think there is maybe the design. Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know. Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know. Um so yeah shapes right, you know, like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something, you know. Yeah. Yes. That is true, because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or, we you know, whatever. And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say, where the hell is my my remote control yeah? Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So if lost If lost uh signal with b throw signal, you know. Exactly, I mean just that's what I'm saying. I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or Okay, my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden, in in other words if it's like in a dark spot, uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top, a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant, at that moment it's it's like, it's like um, what you call it a light s sensors, you know? In in that moment it has a sensor, i it it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep, I mean, that we can discuss that later, you know. That's right. You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough. Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to certain degree and What with Oh yeah well, but then those people we can't help everybody. Okay we have uh yeah, we have to move along, but I think we have some good good points to start with here. Okay, the next meeting will be in thirty minutes. I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this? Okay so well, you got the notice um uh. The working design, I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this? The industrial designer That's you. Okay. So, we looking for a working design when we come back. Then And then the technical funct you are the technical function, so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design. And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general. That would be your idea. And, of course, price. That it, that it, that the price is a good price. I mean, the price is given, but, that was That's right. That's right. And, you know, specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that. I think that's the end of the show. Yeah. So um we have well, we have a twen two two two three minutes. Um any questions at this point? Or uh suggestions? I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh, uh I guess, you can uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes. And see what we can come up with. Okay?

ES2010c.json,"Just trying to move mine right now. They want everything, but simply. Okay. Yeah th I I can I can address some of that issue, I think, with uh my presentation. Okay. Mine will always read copy of something or other. I I copied mine before I sent it over. Hmm. Okay, my turn. Whoo. It'll be copy of component design. Yeah. Th that looks like it. 'Kay. So basic remote operation runs as follows, press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit, chip senses the connection, chip produces a morse code infra-red signal, specific to that button. So you press the button, it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button. Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre, which interprets the signal response accordingly, changes channel etcetera. So that being said Next slide, please. Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction, so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed, we need rubber for buttons, aluminium for battery y contacts, integrated circuit which consists of a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitator, all those basic things that make a circuit function. Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself. An L_E_D_, which is a light emitting diode, um contact discs for the buttons, plastic for the casing, and a power-source, whatever power-source we've actually determined we want. Next slide, please. Thank you. Uh personal preferences, uh to save money for the components, the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse. Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips, casing, L_E_D_, any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing, we should go for it. Next slide, please. Um just talking to the um manufacturing division. They suggested power options, solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power, so you shake it and it increases the power. Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works, they have yet to get back to me on that. So next slide, please. Suggested casing options. Okay. We can offer options for casing such as straight, curved, double-curved, you know, very specific to the customer. Options for materials, plastic, rubber, titanium, wood. I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one, because splinters Yeah. Um certain restrictions do apply here though. Uh latex, you can't do solar power with a latex one. So, if they want some a soft squishy rubber, they can't have the solar powered option. Double-curved, you can't do titanium. Um that would be two curvatures, so it would actually, if you the shape of your hand, you curve here and you curve here, so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold. Now if you wanted that, you can't do titanium. And uh so you functions what for the buttons, scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves. I think I have one more slide. No, I didn't. Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip, which we could utilise. Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip. So depends on what we decide we wanna do. In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote, we're going to have to have multiples of each type, like a double-curved in rubber, um you know, each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options. So we'll have to mix it up, make sure we produce enough of everyone. But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand, you know, double-curved wooden remotes. And that's all I got. Well, we are making the chip. So, I mean But, I guess, we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different, you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options, maybe. So that we could reduce cost. Yeah. Okay. I think the p That's true. If we do a voice-activated locator, though, we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip. So Honestly, I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small, compact Mm yeah. Yeah. 'Kay so The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash. You know it happens. I've had three watches go that way too. Pieces everywhere. Well, we have lots of options. I don't think wood is a viable option. However, well, we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium, make them a rarity so to speak. Yeah. Well the original Okay. Yeah. Good plan. Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex, because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour. We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so, because this year is all fruit, God only knows why, um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids, you know They could come back. And buy the extra case. So we could do like a b a hard base plastic, and then we could give two latex covers to start. How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated Well, we could give it a specific code, you know, remote missing. Yeah, see that would just irritate me. So I think having a key-phrase is much better. No. That would be like a mid-class um Yeah. So we don't actually have to go for Well, if they've just developed the sample sensor, sample speaker, it's a brand new chip. Why not introduce it in this way? I think, well, we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium, 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products, right? So they're more widely available now. And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries. But if you only have to replace it every five years. Well, how about a initial, you get one battery when you buy it, 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk. Yeah. In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side, which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side, that could be particularly useful. Well, if it's just up and down Volume or channel. I don't know. Mm yeah. We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then, 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this, you know. Okay. We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on, so we'll have to like have a little square or something, so that the our logo's available. Yeah, I don't think we should do that, because that would just be icky. So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea. For our base one? It'll wear off. There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons, so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be. Yeah. Great. Play Doh. Wonderful Ooh.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so trend watching. Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics, it is kind of important how our product looks. So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next. So what they want. Right now customers want fancy versus functional. Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want, describing like the in order of how much they want, fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like, fancy versus functional, and then it has to also be technologically innovative, and yet easy to use. So the customer basically is confused. They don't know exactly what they want. They want us to tell them. Yes. Exactly. So we can go to next. Okay. So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing, shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns. So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year. I don't know really, I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff, you'd want like a softer touch. I mean do you guys know what I mean. Yeah. Um. But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns, I don't know if we really want to go with that, because it is just a trend, and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months, because Yeah. I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now. Okay. Awesome. Um so design preferences, um we need easy to read like large buttons, clearly labelled so that, I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem. Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch, you said that in your design, with the bulb. Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme. Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously. That's one of our key goals, we wanna promote our product. And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something. Actually right here. So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this, where we put the buttons around, like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle, I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down, and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape. 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool. So it's classically retro. So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it. And, yep. And that's it. That's cute. Yeah. I have four of those remotes. Okay. That would be amazing, though, yeah. No, splinters would What is that? Mm. Right. Okay. Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier. Yeah, like using the menu to be like, enter your name into the screen like on the menu options. So that way the remote reads it. I feel like voice recognition would be, I don't know, w it would be too hard to really I mean we could do it, but Technology. And it is a growing trend, the higher technological, like the, I mean just like the more advanced it is, the better it'll sell. Yeah, 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy. Oh the base, yeah. W We need to decide, well so we can figure how big it's gonna be, like exactly what buttons we want and exactly It could be like this. Yes. I'd, well uh This one is really comfortable, like I like the sides whatever, because But if we have the um, the locator, then we don't have to worry about that. So we can make it small if we have a l locating device. Hmm. Two double A_s, for this size. Right. Yeah. Smaller, without Yeah. I think if we had a a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced. Yeah. Yeah, because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now, those trends the smaller the hotter it is, yeah Oh. Yeah. Ouch. A phone, whoa, that would wow, that would hurt. Yeah wood. Yeah, 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip, titanium will be more expensive. Yeah. We could do that, because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if Good plan. Oh. Yeah, who knows. O or we could like take off this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because the soft latex definitely is squishy. That's in. Well I mean squishier than like, yeah, just a hard plastic. 'Cause that uh what it type of, yeah, for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like, because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time. So uh Ooh. Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it, because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big, because it's, I don't know, it's just so high-tech. Oh, then maybe voice maybe voice activation won't be good. Yeah, n n no, we just want it to be a finder. But do can your can the department make Oh, brilliant then. Yeah, good point. I think triple A_, it'll be lighter. I mean more more come in a package. Yeah. That's a good point. We could think about it and come back to it next meeting. We still have one more meeting. Yeah, it could be whatever, as long as there's something big in the middle, because like the old phones, there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle. Oh, that's true. Good point. So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top? But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side, we definitely have to have 'em labelled. Yeah, like on the side of it. Oh if it's just up and down. Well, you could do some on both sides. Yeah. That's squishy. That's squishy. have buttons. Yeah, that. Yeah. Yeah, or like a gun-metal grey, 'cause then it combines the silver and the black. Yeah, buttons wear off. Hmm. But we want it to be seen. We need it to be seen. Right. Yeah. Some of tho Well, some of those buttons though are blue-based. Um well, a lot of those buttons are blue-based. Well, kind of. Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact, they could illuminate yellow. Like if we like the one all the way on the left, uh you ca you can see it on your computer better. Um where the button is actually blue, but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow. So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah.
Okay hang on. See if it's there. I don't know. Hang on. Interface concepts, no? Either refresh it, or it sh Oh wait, maybe I didn't put it there. Hang on. Sorry, hang on. Don't know. Okay. Okay, um looking at the interface concept, it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this. Uh if you wanna start the next slide. Um uh can't really see, but there's two possible ways, on the r left, if you see on th on the sides of of the remote, you have the sort of scroll down, so you have that option right there. And then also there's the idea of the base. That's sort of like an idea there. And then on the right, we have what's really big trend right now, it's the iPod. It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons, and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip, but also very sleek and um and very simple, but technologically advanced. So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it, but Anyway, next. Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight. You'd you know you're in the dark, you don't wanna be looking at the remote control. And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_, and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up. What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down, because the down arrow. And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up. Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type, which could be you know, iffy, um sort of old-fashioned in a way. Either that or just have it by shape, for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow. And then the round ones you sort of feel by, you know, that's the second one down, that sort of thing. So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel. Okay. Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic. Um this is particularly geared towards children. Um it's very cute, and we could probably change it to yellow, bright yellow for like a the for the company logo. Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking. Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch, so it's like they ch watch, you know, the C_ Beebies or something like that, uh keep them away from other channels. So that's like another ar Um, I mean, these are three examples sort of looking at it. You have the wider section for the main controls there. Uh you could see how many buttons there are. And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons, and a simpler design. On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that, because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using. Um. So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_, Real Reaction. And then finally these are like the sort of same examples, but also some more, just possibilities that we could go with. None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way. But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying, well out of this one we like, you know the round section of um, b or we'd like the the button size on this. Right. That's it. Right. Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before, and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition. Um. Right except that it's sort of odd, and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are, um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So, you would say like, good morning, coffeemaker, and it would respond, good morning, Jill, but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work, 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions. So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question, and can't change it in order for it to be recognised, or can it be altered in a certain way, or does the actually user program it, to say a channel means this. Right, so it's got like a limited memory and programme it. So it's sort of iffy, but that's kind of what you'd say. I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like, before 'Cause if it's something really really small, then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it, that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up Right. Well, the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons, so we want it to be bigger than this, 'cause it still fits in your hand, so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial, but not necessarily full of buttons. Are you gonna lose it easier? Yeah. So i That's the other thing, it's like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period? But like, you know, if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size. So we sh Yeah. I'm a away from the base. Yeah. Smaller and smaller, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're kidding. Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone. Well, titanium s I was saying that titanium, if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that. Yeah. That'll Yeah, exactly. The selling point, yeah. Are we restricted by this? Twenty five Euros So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it? Okay. The what the top face, right? Yeah. A tracker, yeah. Well, my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring, and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work. And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse, and you couldn't turn it off. So it became highly irritating. But then it Hmm. Okay. Well, that depends on what the energy is needed. As long as we sell it with it. Right, that's what I meant. What's it gonna Yeah, what's it gonna look like. Um. Well, my issue with that is if it got too big though, 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle, then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are, because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it? Yeah. But is that for Which? Do we have both sides? Well, the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side. Um what colour? Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that. And that's at the bottom of it. Which button? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button. What's the button Well, w w then what's the button do, and how do you know that that is what the button does? I guess. Just looking at examples, y you just don't ever see the logo on a button, it's always on the actual casing. But you don't But uh, yeah, you don't see it. Well, hang on. The other option is, I don't know if you can see it but it's like if Yeah, it's like the second to last slide. Interface, yeah. Yeah. Um. Okay, it's the very right one. You see at the bottom, it's kind of difficult to see, but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like, where the logo is, and if we have the replaceable section, it's like the top. It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top. And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in. If c you envisioning it? And so that stays the same when you have the logo, and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right. That's like, you know, a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened. And so, what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_? Yellow. Yeah. Oh, that one. Um. Ha hang on Let me catch up. Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before? Yeah. Fun.
Okay. Hi Team. Hope you had a good lunch. Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting. Um let's get started. 'Kay, here is the agenda for today's meeting. Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager. We're gonna have three presentations, one from each of you again. And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up. And we have forty minutes again. 'Kay, and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control. Okay. Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations. Who would like to go first? Okay. Um Courtney would you mind starting us off? Okay. Trend watching? 'Kay. Mm 'kay. Mm. Mm. Right. Yes. Right. Right. People don't buy a new remote every so often. Okay. Hmm. Very good. I like it. Okay, ready for the next slide? Op mm 'kay. Great. Great presentation. Ready? 'Kay. Which one is it? Interface concepts new. Y 'Kay. Sorry? Oh okay. Oh there we go. Sure. Mm 'kay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. No. Mm. Or I like, you know, the black finish or the silver finish or whatever. Good lord. Okay. Ready? Oh, yeah. Okay. Great job. Okay. What's the title? Got it. Hmm. Interesting. Mm. 'Kay. No, okay. Mm. Hmm. Okay. Alright, well thank you for those informative presentations. Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions. Where were we? Sure. Mm. Right. Right. Mm. Hmm. Programme. If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would, you know, technology Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Okay, that kind of brings us to this, let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost. Um. Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier? The base, the charging base with rechargeable batteries? Hmm. Yeah, and we don't have multiple things that it has to control, it just has to control the T_V_. It's not gonna be a huge universal remote. What size battery and Right. I agree, it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just A battery like this guy. Alright, so what direction do you want to go in? You wanna vote? I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of bigger and the base. That just seems so clunky and Okay. Hmm. Okay, so what kind of material do we want to be made out of? No. Oh what did you Oh sorry, go ahead. Right. What would you recommend? Mm. I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes. If this was a successful remote, we might then produce a higher end version of it, I think. Okay, so we wanna go for plastic, or what would you recommend for materials? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. They could buy cases, maybe, if they wanted. I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options. Okay. Okay. Right. Right. Okay, and what kind of chip would we need for this guy? I don't think we should do voice, I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost, you know. could we Yeah. Hmm. Right. Oh dear. Okay. Okay. Alright. But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say, channel up, and it would work, right? Just a Okay, alright. No. Mm 'kay. Uh and what size batteries, double A_, triple A_? Two? Could it run off of two They're more expensive though, too. Mm. Thoughts anybody? Okay. Yeah. Alright. Okay. So we've covered that first category, User Interface Concept, meaning design. Okay. I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial, and that the central button could have, maybe our logo on it? It might be the four way scroll, too. I mean if Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Oh, I see what you mean. I think so. Yeah, I like that. 'Kay. Mm. Can we? So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan Mm. Yeah. Hmm. 'Kay any other ideas? Oh, yeah. Latex covers. W I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though, because if people are able to change the covers, I don't know, maybe the on-off button, something, some the menu button, I don't know, but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one. Are they all gonna have our company logo on them? Every cover? Yeah. If we want it to be visible and Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking? But those are plastic, right? They're not titanium. I kind of like that look. Uh but, or if it was really Yeah, for the base or if we're going for the retro look, I think, like a really shiny black would be cool. What are your thoughts? Gun-metal gray. There you go, gun-metal gray. Why? Mm. Right. On the back? It d visible Visibility though 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery. I can find it again. Okay. And yours was called Interface Concept? This one? Well, for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly. Mm. Okay, yes yes. Okay. Like a little cut-out kind of Okay. Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones? Mm. Mm. Yellow, I like that idea. Mm. Mm. I like the yellow illumination idea, very good. Okay. Any other ideas or thoughts? We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so 'Kay. I think there will be time for that later. I'm guessing. 'Kay, well we're gonna wrap this up. Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes, and here's what we're each of us going to do. The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design, the U_I_D_ the user interface design. I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it, but I think, that's pretty much what you're gonna do, right? I guess. 'Kay. And you're gonna do some product evaluation. Okay, and right now, the I_D_ and U_I_D_, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. Yeah. Okay, and you should all be getting an email pretty soon. Alright. Well, thank you for a very productive meeting.
@highlight
Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting .
@highlight
Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager .
@highlight
We're gonna have three presentations , And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts Okay , so trend watching .
@highlight
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use .
@highlight
So the customer basically is confused .
@highlight
So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .
@highlight
um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something .
@highlight
So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , So it's classically retro .
@highlight
looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .
@highlight
Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod .
@highlight
and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced .
@highlight
Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight .
@highlight
for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow .
@highlight
Um this is particularly geared towards children .
@highlight
Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking .
@highlight
and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction .
@highlight
But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this .
@highlight
So basic remote operation runs as follows , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want .
@highlight
They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer .
@highlight
Um certain restrictions do apply here though .
@highlight
And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .
@highlight
Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .
@highlight
Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip .
@highlight
Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .
@highlight
um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions .
@highlight
I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .
@highlight
let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
It's not gonna be a huge universal remote .
@highlight
'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .
@highlight
If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip .
@highlight
Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .
@highlight
Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?
@highlight
I don't think wood is a viable option .
@highlight
'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .
@highlight
um we could do f a cherry cover for this year So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start .
@highlight
Are we gonna go with the voice activated I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know .
@highlight
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .
@highlight
Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ?
@highlight
or we could do one small lithium , I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?
@highlight
'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .
@highlight
Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .
@highlight
I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .
@highlight
or like a gun-metal grey , I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .
@highlight
It'll wear off .
@highlight
so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .
@highlight
Like a little cut-out kind of Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .
@highlight
The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design .
@highlight
Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
@highlight
I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put 'Kay .
@highlight
And you're gonna do some product evaluation .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

IS1004b.json,"Yep. Yes. Mm. Uh the Powerstick. Maybe a Spanish name would work well. Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there. Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish. Mando. What is that? What does it mean in Spanish? Control. Okay. 'Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might The Mando. Yeah that's. And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special, so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though, do you? So Yeah. Marketing. Well that's the thing. We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a Um. Yeah. More likely. Well th the on the thing is though, most remote controls are used by more than one person. So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market. Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand, right? Well it can still be a, you can still extend past the hand. Uh. Well it means like, this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or, you know, with maybe some some finger molds or something. Some finger grips maybe. You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything, but Yeah. Yeah. No. I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there, this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though, but um yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah. I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the Uh participant three. You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder, so. Oh you press a press a button to talk, and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay, so, could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse, or Mm. Thanks. Okay. Great. Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote, and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes, and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com, which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site. So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant, but it's not really it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive. There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there. So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions, which have a couple of of their own buttons. Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market, I know we're working on television remote, but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times. But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it, which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel, which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do. And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel. Now um uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel. 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad. I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number, and then two numbers, so that's just uh it's annoying. So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy. Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen, and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability. One possibility, if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro, but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on, you know, often you don't know what ch what channel it's on, or you don't know what's on. If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel. So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number, you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it. So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have, but um we we really need t to discuss the price. So, I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple, there's only a few buttons, but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context. So this is something else we might wanna consider, is really kind of limiting the number of buttons, because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions. It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control. And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks, but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important, but also the number of buttons. So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want. So Yeah well we w Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control. Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time, but contains the extra buttons like, say, the number buttons for instance. Um I I would if I had my perfect remote control, I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way. They don't really do anything. Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever, but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good. Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum, but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device. Um Well I guess that depends on how you market it. If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can, you know, navigate to a program without the numbers, then people might say that looks pretty easy. So, but yep. Um okay, so, I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number. So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing. Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen, um which maybe maybe is too expensive, um but I think also at the scroll wheel, I haven't mentioned it here, the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen, just for changing channel numbers easily. I think even that, I mean, that would be a fairly cheap thing, compared to an L_C_D_ screen, to implement, um but I think that would be quite useful as well. And the other thing, you say we need to we need to keep it just television, but I think one maybe one option, since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device, is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology, and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks. Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can, say uh, change the lighting in the room. You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra, so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development, but, you know, later on you could you can you know you also, selling the potential of the device. Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights, I dunno, close the windows, whatever, turn the heating on, and um, I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool, since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics. Hmm. Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets, though, because, I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this, but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries. So then you have to s you know, you have to train models for Yeah. You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up, and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well, by speaking and doing Yeah. Actually I'm not so sure because I'm the you know if I was using a remote control to, say, turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well, I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control. You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear, I'm trying to actually find out what's being said, so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps. Well it depends if it's a remote control th Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore, that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion. If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it, then that could be. Well it depends though well it depends. If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that. Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there, but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus. So that's an extra cost. Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote. Are we still you say we're focusing on T_V_, but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control, or is this something for our own line of of televisions? 'Cause that really makes a big difference. 'Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s. It's just there are too many T_V_s out there. It's it's not really gonna For twenty five Euro? I think it's impossible. But but I dunno, I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control, and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics. So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah because yeah. Well th 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers, like an interactive programme guide. You can get a lot more information on it. So you could have the name of the programme, you could have um the start time you know where it's up to. You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading Well no, but there are the electronic programme guides out there. They may not have pictures, but maybe they do. There's dependi it also depends on the country. No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from. So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that. Uh. Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control, especially if we don't control the T_V_. I dunno. We need to find that out. Mm. If it's a really small T_V_ maybe. Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe, or a you know. Well this is what we need to find out. Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control? 'Cause otherwise we need It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna Ninety five percent is not good enough though. Yep.
Uh. Mm I was thinking of the Mando. Mando. A_N_ yeah D_O. It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me, but maybe for a Spanish for I for Control. But mm, yeah. Mando sounds Latino. But yeah it uh Yeah because if the product will be international Maybe maybe I should uh start. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Should be in participant four. Yeah, yeah. Uh. Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting. For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements. I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls. And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five, ten years. There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and Yeah. Yeah. Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly, thoroughly. So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control, which is which is good and it's interesting point. Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease, which is if you repeat the sa the same movement, which is not a with a not very appropriate device, you you will have problems whe when you will get old. So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control. They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often, so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost. And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control. So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is, the more like the the liklier it is to get lost. Liklier or more likely? likely. Okay. Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control. Also the z the design should fit the hand shape. So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes, for right and left handed people. Yeah. I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls. Sorry? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry? Yeah. Like uh Yeah, like No no I was thinking of so like something yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical. Not anymore. That's what yeah. And finally, the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting, but I don't know if the budget would be large enough. But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology. Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls. Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate, so yeah yeah. Yeah uh channel fifty. Yeah. H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional If y I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it. I'm sure. Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons, it's about it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour, or something like that. With a good shape for the Yeah. Uh What would be Wha but what would be one question, what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control? What what kind of information? Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the the n Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays. Yeah. So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_? Okay. But Yeah. I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_. Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements. You need a internet connection. You need m more things. But for the speech recognition you you don't need anything. You just say channel fifty, and that's it. But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars, it's To move to another target? the expert uh said ninety five percent.
Yep. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher. So we should be careful. Yep. Well maybe it could be a universal design. A universal design, which is which is good for both the hands. Yeah? That's right, whether it's left hand or right hand, but but don't you think that the two points are clashing, one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small? The first and the third point, they are clashing. Okay. So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones? Little sleek, longer? And it should fit the hand. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm. No it could be command control kind of thing. It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated. Means you say you should say like does that, remote control being on or be on kind of thing, and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition. Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also. So there should be something command controlled, you start and then you stop. It's like V_I_ editor, you are having two modes similarly. Otherwise it's just lying idle. Change the channels. Yeah. Mmm-hmm mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality. Because the same button is doing too many things. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It does sampling out of the. Yep. So yeah. So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh, that means on my own I yeah, it should be. Two. Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types, one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology. So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this, and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes, it can it can be useful for them, and the new users, as uh our Marketing Expert was saying, they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing. That's right. So anyway, that didn't come into my mind, so th that is a possibility. These could be other kind of interfaces. Means we can have, depending on the cost, how much we can afford, we can have different kind of interfaces. So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with. So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is, and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking. Otherwise we are just like others in the market. So anyway that is the first, user interface could be of more than one type, and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually. So apart from the speech, we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons. Now for buttons, normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required. And for voice, limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote. Uh that's right. But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that. Uh yes, if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough. Yeah we we can uh target, means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc That's right. No it it could be little d yeah it could be That's right. That's right. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Uh it's more like, means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest. So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself, and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is, instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So we can That's right. Yep. Yep. No no. Components. Yeah. So, will you go to the next slide? Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so. We are having a power button and the switch, which is not much, and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not. And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time. So we could not put that. So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting, similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there. So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there, and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller, and then there could be buttons, and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format. And then there is there is the chip which is sitting, the green one, and it converts it into bit codes, and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver. So this is the easiest design the there could be. So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in. To have different technologies. So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control. Yeah. Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up. So these are the slight problems. Because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea, but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was So if we go with just the Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. It's not possible. It's impossible. Are But just a small thing, what kind of market we are targeting? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market, or what? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself. That is very important. Broke. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_. Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah, that's right. Okay.
Okay everybody is ready? Good morning again. So, today we are going to have a f second meeting. Oh Michael, hi. You're late. You have a good reason for that? Very good. Okay, let's have a look to the agenda today. So, we are going to have a meeting about the functional design. Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting. So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control, but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics. I goin I'm going to share with you. And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design. You showed us you ar you you prepare something for us? The U_I_ guy also uh work on that, yeah, and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs. Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations. But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project. So, I just put d quickly Remo, but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly. Any ideas? Powerstick, yeah. What else? What else? Mango? Mango? Mando. M_A_? M_A_? M_ D_O_. Mm, okay. What does it mean? Oh. Hmm. Nice. Okay. So, let's go for Mando? Yeah? No objection? Great. So Okay, I think this is Okay. Okay, I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel. Something that should be addressed later. We should we should go to other for the other topics. Yeah okay, so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later. So let's go for the three presentations right now. So, who want to start? So maybe we could start with the market, yeah. Okay so I have your slides somewhere? Participant four. This one? S that's coming. Uh okay. Great. Mm-hmm. Okay. Sh next slide? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Something with the shape of the palm? On the sides. And then finally Yeah. First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because Yeah, so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations. We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company, and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_. Okay, I dunno if you had this information already. No, so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations. Um they want also uh Excellent. So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally, it should be clear that the corporate image, that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product. So Yeah yeah. Sure sure. So maybe we can jump to your presentations, right now. Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco Sorry, what is your? Okay Michael. Sorry? Um yeah. The wheel doesn't work. Looks like a P_D_A_? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, can you continue, please Mi? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay, thanks. you want to go? This one? Great. No, not that one. you are two. Alright. Okay, sorry to interrupt you, but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That increases the the cost also. Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough? Okay. Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control. So it could be s a few centimetres. Yeah. Okay. Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide. This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion. Okay, next. Uh that finished? No? Components? Yes sure. Okay. Okay. So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies? Yeah. Okay so Okay gentlemens, we have to take some deci decisions right now. Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said. We are targeting T_V_. We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy, which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small, not too big. Um we have or good shape, yes. We should bring new technologies for young peoples, and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet. Maybe this is something we can stick to it. And um also, a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate. So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price, it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_. Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have. Yeah that's right. Don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or well systems that exist that we can use? Yeah. Yeah. That's good point. What's what cou what could be the cost of uh well, could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? Yeah. So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value? Okay, so regarding the automatic speech recognition, I think this is They have tele teletext. Well, because they have teletext on it. Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel. They have t most of them have teletext, but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet. So to to uh to browse more easily the teletext. For instance through uh through your remote control. The ti the start time, all the p all the programmes you could have uh o Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext, also. Well because for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the T_V_. We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there. So so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse, in addition to the T_V_, or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to Okay. We need to close the meeting. Um so Very quickly. No. Yeah, well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their, and they want to go t for universal one, and they take the fanciest they can have. So this is that we z that that we should target. So the com the um the uh the committment is the following, we don't go for speech recognition technology. The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting. So Yeah, but not sure. Maybe it's cheaper, but we have no Okay this is this is an open question for you. Yeah. This is uh up to you to tell us. But I'm definitely not keen on to to no no no, I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies. I'm not confident enough. I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work. I uh that work It's real yeah. How to guarantee such performances is really hard. Well this is still is is very bad. So, this is the end of this discussion. Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on. Um so you have to work on the component uh concept. Uh you have to work on user interface, and you have to go through a trend watching. Okay. So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing. Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction. Thanks. Bye.
@highlight
Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .
@highlight
So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design .
@highlight
Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .
@highlight
So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics .
@highlight
I goin I'm going to share with you .
@highlight
so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .
@highlight
But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project .
@highlight
So , I just put d quickly Remo , Any ideas ?
@highlight
Uh Maybe a Spanish name would work well .
@highlight
Mando .
@highlight
What does it mean in Spanish ?
@highlight
Control .
@highlight
So , let's go for Mando ?
@highlight
you could have the fonts you know special , Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , I I think this is more a question of of look and feel .
@highlight
Something that should be addressed later We should we should go to other for the other topics .
@highlight
So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .
@highlight
and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
@highlight
And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .
@highlight
So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
@highlight
So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .
@highlight
Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .
@highlight
Well maybe it could be a universal design .
@highlight
And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .
@highlight
But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .
@highlight
We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .
@highlight
and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .
@highlight
So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the it could be command control kind of thing .
@highlight
It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
@highlight
Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site .
@highlight
and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel .
@highlight
because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .
@highlight
Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance .
@highlight
Um if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .
@highlight
because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .
@highlight
the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .
@highlight
and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks .
@highlight
Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology .
@highlight
and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote .
@highlight
but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .
@highlight
And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .
@highlight
That increases the the cost also .
@highlight
Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?
@highlight
Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .
@highlight
I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .
@highlight
Actually I'm not so sure you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control .
@highlight
we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .
@highlight
We should bring new technologies for young peoples , So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .
@highlight
you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?
@highlight
well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?
@highlight
For twenty five Euro ?
@highlight
I think it's impossible .
@highlight
because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price .
@highlight
what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?
@highlight
So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .
@highlight
Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?
@highlight
I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ .
@highlight
so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .
@highlight
we don't go for speech recognition technology .
@highlight
I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know .
@highlight
But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?
@highlight
I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .
@highlight
Um so you have to work on the component uh concept .
@highlight
Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching .
@highlight
So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .","**Meeting Agenda: MANDO Project Update**

IS1003c.json,"Mm-hmm. Mm. A nice one. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Oh yeah, that's a good that's a good point, so. One and Yep. Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the That's right. It's it's And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers, eh. No, more expensive maybe. Well y y you have also the language problem, you know when you 'Cause it it have to be universal, so. Yeah. Yeah but you know. The product The pro It's a very smart, it's a very smart controller maybe Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. But Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller, you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world, the same one. If you have the language, you have to develop for each country. Yeah, but for each country you have to do one, because uh the for example for Se Oh really? That's Comple A microphone maybe. To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe. I if you say one, he switch to channel, yeah. So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one. Devic Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control. Yeah. But I think that, you know, switching from one country to to another will be a problem, so although y y Yeah but i i Yeah, we should. Uh. Mm. Yeah, but I think he need a control that is very reliable, so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that. But uh I think a user need Don't have a the the Yeah if we can send email from it. Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if Yeah And for all the person of the family maybe, so, yeah. Because you have new Ye Okay. Okay. Yeah, participant two um Yeah, working design, so. So I think Can you go to the next one? I uh it's not this one. It's uh oth the oth so I It's the working design. Sorry. Component design. So this yeah so this is the described use What? Are you inst I don't think so. Oh. Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer. Okay, okay. Yes. I can say it to you without. Yeah, exac Okay. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, I don't know, I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control. So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so. So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use, so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one. So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button, so it can be some, you know, classic pushbutton like this one, or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know, the button the buttons are unlighted during the night, or, you know, you can see them in the darkness. And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation, electric alimentation do you want to have, so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so. And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them, so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from, you know, the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal, so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation, you just, when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it, for example. Yeah. Yeah, yeah mm. Ecologists, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alrigh In fact, having them both will if we want to have battery, regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price, but it will be an added value also that will be compensated, so hmm. And the materials, it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but, you know, something wooden will be like, I don't know high cl so a special high class, or you know, you can have some Yeah, even if it is not completely wood, but just a part of the, you know, will be wooden, in wood and it can be interesting. And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits, chips, or do you have low level or or very very expensive, it depends, but I think that low level will be, you know, it is an interim module. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think it will fit on the price we want, twel twelve Euros, so. I think the buttons I pr I prefer, you know, the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because, you know, it's I don't know um yeah, in the dark, it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost, you know in the darkness it's very easy so, right. I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so. But And it is a kind of other design, I mean. It can also be interesting to have this kind of Mm. Ah yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah. Okay. And fruit and vegetables yeah. Spongy 'Kay. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy? Pla S Very stuff Okay, rubber rubber desi okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Solar. Okay. Yeah. It will be a Yeah. Yeah, I think Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No wood but Plastic? Would some I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and, you know. It depends on the design we want, so. Yeah, it's natural and i And it can be correlated to energy, solar energy, so for the marketing aspect, you know, saying that it's ecol Mm, yeah, it's not right, so. Okay. Google and and fancy, f how about the the voice? And Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control. Mm. Yeah. But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_, so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually, so. But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control, so. Yeah, L_C_D_. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And pf what can we think a supplement to I think the supplement can be the voice. It is just, you know, it is not the most important, but it can be a part of Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. To push button, yeah, yeah. Even it is for s just some kids, you know, switching channels one two three four. Yeah, turning yeah, yeah. Not very complex commands, but easy commands, so. Yeah. Yeah, simple ones for expensive buttons Yeah, to make some new Yeah. Okay, fruits. Okay. Need it to be, okay. Okay. Okay. Sounds good, mm-hmm.
Yep. Yeah. No no no. Yeah. Mm. So uh first I will present the concept of user interface. Um there's three concepts in the user interface. So first one it's a Google controller. The second is a fancy controller. The last one is uh intelligent controller. So there are three concepts in our controller. Um n next I will explain one by one, the first is Google controller. Um, so I want the controller to be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions. So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions. Uh this is a first concept of our controller. The second concept is a fancy controller, um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive, um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products, so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute, very very g um attractive. Such like this, there are several uh examples in the slides. Yeah, it's very, you know if you're Yeah. It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it. Or to recognise it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the last uh concept is intelligent. We want uh we want our controller to be smart, so maybe we should uh use um uh technology, such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology, so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition. Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user. Okay. No. There this is the three concepts of our controller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so Y Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button. For example, if you cannot find your uh controller, you can just uh just just uh speak something such as, yeah, one two. Yeah. So you can use your gesture. That's no problem. For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very Yeah. Yeah, they cannot speak at the same time. Yeah, it's very interesting. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three, so it's c come to channel three, I don't have to It's advantage. How much? No no we we d we we just are use um No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute, we don't have to do some basic research on this field. Yeah, I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition, it's very it's uh yeah. It's No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the The vocabulary is very small, so that's not a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the key, the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation mechanism. It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese. It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French. Yeah, it's Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed. So Yeah. Yeah. Oh n Yeah, yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation. Yeah. Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to No, it's not so complex. No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone. It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller. Where is the controller? It's in your family, in your home. Yeah. Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here. Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here, then you you use your command and you do s your gesture. No no it's n y if you lose it Yeah. Yeah. I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah. You can see they can switch form one modality to another. No, that's quite inter quite attractive. Well, if you do language adaptation, there should be no problem. We should have confidence in technology. More features, yeah. Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts. So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market? There's no k features of our controller, so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features? Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that Yeah, you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller, that's a function of T_V_. You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function, but Okay. But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller, it's it's also the issue of the T_V_. Yeah, but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller, but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it, your mobile, but you when you choose a new mobile, you choose the one with voice recognition. That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable, but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products. Yeah. Yeah, uh Yeah, if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable, would you replace it with another one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yes, but there's no big difference between the traditional controller. The then nn no. Tha But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller. That's the same yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It did didn't r receive it. Didn't receive it. Participant one. Participant one. Yeah, maybe we can first come to uh to Frahan. With Frahan, then you can prepare your slides, then present it later. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So you got email? Mm. Later? Pla Uh yes. Yeah. Yeah. The smart controller. Okay. Mm. Yeah. It's good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yep Okay. Okay.
Mm-hmm. No y you do the minutes first, or? No? Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition? Okay. Okay. But this this but this would never happen anyway. Yeah Yeah, but the Yeah but this Yeah. I don't think it Oh, okay, okay, you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff. No. No, but this is disadvant disadvantage. Yeah. Uh if you if if you use the basic But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built. Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition, for example. Yeah. Yeah, this could be downloaded by the web maybe, or Yeah. Mm. Yeah, but then w Yeah, we have to take care of the twelve Euros problem. Okay. No, but then it's it's like this uh Yeah. But you would still have the buttons. Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons? Okay, so you yeah. Yeah, I dunno. It's a bit risky risky. Yeah, I dunno. What? If if I mean, uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price, he's happy to have recognition. But if if if it like doubles uh no one would would be interested. Yeah. No, I mean Y No, but you need you need new remote controller then. Because if you wanna browse internet or, I don't know, if you wanna type something, or No. No. Cause for example yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you wou you would True. I mean, for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller. I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google. Google is is simple, works fine, so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic, simple and works fine, it's already a lot. Uh thi this I mean, the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice and it's easy easy to use, easy to use. See That's the problem, yeah. I mean, I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever. But you have to think, the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so. I mean, that's the point. Hmm. Yeah. Dunno. I dunno if you remember what you had to say or I think it's more interesting what he says, okay. Yeah, true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Special for Mm-hmm. Yeah. What about the touch scr touch screen? For example. It's it's expensive I I guess. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Uh no, trend watching. The other one. Yeah. Uh, I think so, just Yeah, so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market, so next. So again, it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting. Um user really really want a fancy look and feel. They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel, okay. Like the one you've shown, David, with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh So, second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative, so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on. At the same time, it's important that it's easy to use. So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis. Now i if we look at fashion in general um Okay. Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables, okay, so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing. 'Cause it's it's really what people want. Even if it's in general fashion, we want it to be in the remote control. And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points, fancy look and feel has, on a score of seven would have six as importance. Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative, it's three. Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones. So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one, and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables. And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch, okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design. I dunno. Yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like, but rubber, mayb maybe, you know, rubber-like uh device, so um Okay, tha tha that was the main point, I think, from the trend in fashion. Yeah, so when I think it's Mm-hmm. Maybe not no wood, but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know. Yeah, maybe the base. But still y Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view. But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons, or I dunno. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah d I dunno. What interface? Yeah, no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends. If possible. Hmm. Okay.
So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design. So, as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision. So I will first uh What? I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first, Mister David Jordan. So, we'll S technical accessoire? Interface? This. I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive. It's very big, yeah. Okay. Yeah, why not. We'll have big discussion I suppose after that, so. Okay. Something else? I just have one question, because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition, but as the um expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures? Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. You don't think so? Yeah, sure. I That's true. Yeah, but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller. Broken arm? Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time? Why? If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme, so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time, so. Yeah, but you have the remote control, so maybe you can keep it f with you. You're not you're not obliged to share it. Yeah, we can yeah. Yeah, I think it's a disadvantage. Yeah, but one other question. How how much will it cost? Yeah. Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working. Some some efficient. So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us? Or? Yeah, but uh uh Mm-mm. Yeah. I agree with uh Yeah, but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international remote control. We need something that is international. Suppose we're we want to sell it in France. The recognition system will be able to understand French. If you want to go to England, it will be able to understand English, so. Mm, okay. And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control? Yeah, but how will you Oh. Seems to be quite complex. And what about voice recognition, do we have microphones? And where will be they? Do you think if we're far from television it will work? Yeah, but where is the controller? Yeah. Yeah, but we're here it's uh an object. But here you say you want to use i uh s technology. Yeah, but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this, if you have an object. If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free, without any object. You just want to interact with television. Yeah, but you can lose it. Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice. Ah. Yeah, but Mm. I think so. And maybe it will be quite Okay. Hmm. So, what do you think? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer. Which kind of controller would you prefer to use, you as a remote control user? So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller. Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller? Hmm? Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller, easy to use, sophisticated and fancy. You think it's possible? Yeah, but uh we want so Yeah, but w we we want something th that works all the time, every day, every hour, for everyone. You don't need to tune it. Yeah, why not? If it's Not too expensive too. Okay. So let's go to the Industrial Designer. Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that, so. Two? Working? I can Okay. It's okay Uh I think there's something wrong with your Maybe you you record it somewhere else. Interface concept. No. Mm mm. Uh. Nope. It seems that we have a problem with the Yeah, so No, I think it will be more interesting to start with uh Yeah. You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation. So. Okay. Okay, never mind. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of production more, no? So. Okay. And what tha what about the uh materials? Impersonal, mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm okay, seems to be interesting, mm. Yeah, we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough. And you think that we will be Okay. So wood. And what about the buttons? No it's fashion, yeah. I dunno. I think we have only uh five minutes left. Participant four? Functional requirements? This one? Okay. So we have to take decisions about the component concepts, about the energy. So, as you say you want something technologically innovative, maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting, maybe will attract pro-ecology consumers. Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well. Case. So you think case. Something spongy. Someth no wood. Maybe you It's it's natural. Th The feeling is natural, so maybe we can stay with wood. But it's still fashion. Yeah, something that you can into it. Uh and what about the user interface concept? Google and fancy? Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this. Yeah, but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice. That's true. So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller, maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood. And L_C_D_ buttons. Yeah, I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add. Yeah, for the interface something added value. With a module? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands, words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers. Turning the T_V_ o on o or off. So, adding some vocal commands. Simple ones? Okay. So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction. So you will have to work on the look and feel design, to have the easy to use, powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition. Uh you will have to work more, Baba, on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control. And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too. Yeah. Yeah. And remember as as I said last meeting, we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control. So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control, so you will have to model model something. And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. So, no more questions, we can close the session. Yeah. Okay, cool.

Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?
@highlight
so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller .
@highlight
Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .
@highlight
And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to How how much will it cost ?
@highlight
more expensive maybe .
@highlight
we don't have to do some basic research on this field .
@highlight
y y you have also the language problem , 'Cause it it have to be universal , The vocabulary is very small , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international The recognition system will be able to understand French .
@highlight
this could be downloaded by the web maybe , And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
@highlight
Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to Seems to be quite complex .
@highlight
It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller .
@highlight
but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .
@highlight
If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .
@highlight
you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .
@highlight
do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?
@highlight
think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user You can see they can switch form one modality to another .
@highlight
It's a bit risky risky .
@highlight
But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .
@highlight
I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .
@highlight
Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ?
@highlight
stick to the first two parts .
@highlight
So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?
@highlight
so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
@highlight
Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that .
@highlight
you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products .
@highlight
but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .
@highlight
so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .
@highlight
if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .
@highlight
But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .
@highlight
let's go to the Industrial Designer .
@highlight
Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , Uh I think there's something wrong with your It did didn't r receive it .
@highlight
Didn't receive it .
@highlight
Maybe you you record it somewhere else .
@highlight
It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
@highlight
something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one .
@highlight
in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , the plastic material is more common but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
@highlight
the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .
@highlight
and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .
@highlight
I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons What about the touch scr touch screen ?
@highlight
For example .
@highlight
It's it's expensive I I guess .
@highlight
I think we have only uh five minutes left .
@highlight
trend watching .
@highlight
just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , Um user really really want a fancy look and feel .
@highlight
Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
@highlight
At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .
@highlight
that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
@highlight
Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .
@highlight
And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
@highlight
Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .
@highlight
Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
@highlight
And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .
@highlight
but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
@highlight
plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .
@highlight
maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .
@highlight
Something spongy .
@highlight
No wood I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know .
@highlight
so maybe we can stay with wood .
@highlight
It's it's natural .
@highlight
But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , Uh and what about the user interface concept ?
@highlight
Google and fancy ?
@highlight
Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .
@highlight
the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
@highlight
And L_C_D_ buttons .
@highlight
I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .
@highlight
commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .
@highlight
Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .
@highlight
Not very complex commands , but easy commands , Yeah , simple ones Okay .
@highlight
we'll you will all have to work in in your direction .
@highlight
So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .
@highlight
Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .
@highlight
And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .
@highlight
So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .","```

IS1001a.json,"Hmm. Mm mm mm. Is recorded? Okay? Okay so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control. So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff, then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it. And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process. So sorry? You have another meeting soon? So you have to be quick. Okay. So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly. So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points. First it will be the functional design. Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design. So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function the remote control should fulfil. And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved, what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that. And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point. So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board. Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us? Okay that's good. n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment. Okay it's an abstract drawing. I think it's nice and original. Okay. You want to draw something Christine? Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost. Is this uh Ah okay it's pretty. Okay it's your cat. Okay. Olivier, do you want to Okay I go, but next time you'll do something I'm sure. I'm a bit short on cable. Okay. So what could I draw? Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow. I don't know if it looks like a cow Like a what? I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say. Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control. Okay. Let's move on. So Here the uh financial objective of our project. That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros. Yeah if it's trendy, original I d fulfil the user needs. We have to discuss that point. On yeah you you can suggest points like this. So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple. So what's what are your ideas about that? Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side? Okay, so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device. Do you agree? Yeah. So maybe it should be for multiple devices. And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil? Few buttons. Okay. And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark? Might be a good idea. Okay. And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain, what it shouldn't it should look like, or things like that? With rou okay. Like for okay. Okay. So. Fit in your hand, yeah. And also it have, i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To, to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall. Water-proof as well. Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't. Maybe water-proof would be very original. Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath. That could be uh Yeah but, it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah, mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well. Yeah. Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well. That might be good uh track to follow. Optional or selled with it? Yeah. Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the T_V_. Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep. Yeah, barks, yeah. So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control? I don't know, whistle-able? Th Whistle tracking yeah. Whistle tracking remote control. That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can uh improve. Yeah d d uh. Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors. I think this is a good advantage. Yeah. We have to ask Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer. Which is you. Okay so try to find that for next meeting. Okay. So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh. Don't pani. So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed. So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user. And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user. So. And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon. So. Thank you I think that's all for this point. Anyway you will receive some messages. Be careful. You eat it? Does it move uh? Okay, but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh We'll see.
How do you wear this thing? Not too many cables and stuff. Original. Uh. Just one thing. Uh, you said twenty-five minutes, but I have something else to do uh, so gotta have another meeting uh soon, so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true. I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah. Yeah, for the lawnmower project. Okay. What an original idea. Orangutan. Can I give you the no? But I don't have to say anything. When I'm drawing the orangutan. It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan. Yes. I don't have a red colour. Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen, so Yes. Yes. I know. Wha what is this strange beast? Is it a monster? It's a cat? I thought these things did not exist. Ah yeah Does have a name? Caramel. Ah-ha. Next time I concentrate. He looks like a bong. Okay. Sorry. No. Scary? I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos, no. That's I is there a matter for a new remote control? Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control? Ah this is not defined at all? Ah, okay. Well uh do we sell other stuff? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us. Yeah. No, I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now. Mm. Something like that, least fits in your hand. Yeah. The basic requirement. Only a buck. Waterproof. Mm. B it seems uh so, but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it. That's people they actually do it themselves. I it will look a bulky in that case. Like as an optional thing. Barks. That's that's quite cool, but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right? So i it's just going to add t to the cost. It's cool. I think I like the idea, but I'm not sure about the what you, who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget. Who's Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Good. Uh, so we come back in five minutes? Half an hour.
Okay uh sorry. You have to imagine a little bit um. This Sorry too uh. Is it beautiful? Do you know? It's a cat. Isn't it? Yes yes is it like that. Is it better? Okay. It's my cat. Yeah. The name is Caramel. Yeah. Thank you
No no n You should write y the name I think. Me Ah yeah. Yeah. Caramel. And you I think I'm too short for the cables. Quite squarey. He also. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part. I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice. Yeah. Something which is not squarey maybe uh, not a box. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I think we should have a device Sorry. Yeah. directly. Yeah. And I I think we should have something, most of the time I I lose my remote control. We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping. Ah yeah. Yeah. Barks. Yeah. Yeah whistle. Whistle tracking. Yeah. yeah Okay. Don't panic. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah.

@highlight
Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .
@highlight
So .
@highlight
Fit in your hand , yeah .
@highlight
Water-proof as well .
@highlight
Maybe water-proof would be very original .

@highlight
We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .
@highlight
Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .
@highlight
That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .
@highlight
So i it's just going to add t to the cost .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .
@highlight
Okay so try to find that for next meeting .
@highlight
So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .
@highlight
So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .

ES2009c.json,"'Kay. I'll go first. No Nathan's fine. It's either Nathan or participant two. Uh. Okay. Um, basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers, so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that. Um, components of a remote control, okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon. Energy source, um, our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources, your standard battery, solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere. Um, and also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically, it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen. So we'll have to look into that. Um, the case, we have a few options, plastic, rubber or wood. Um and then as far as the way it's shaped, we can do standard boring flat, which we probably don't wanna do, curved or very sexy double curved. Um, I imagine that we could specify. Um, I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres. Yeah. Um, the buttons, there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer, but to use those we'd have to use more chips, um and that would cost us more. And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that. Um and just a little note there, touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro. Um, one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that. And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light. Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick. So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it. Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that. Yeah. I am sure that we could do that. Um, of course Yeah, just as a fun gimmick. Just to set us apart a little bit. Um, and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use, also known as the chip. Uh, we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five. Um findings, okay, we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer, um and my question to all of you is, should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available? 'S a bit of a challenge question. Right, that's my concern too. Um, if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer. My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table, uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route, just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on. Uh, I like the idea of the visible light signalling, that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes. So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know, say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation. Oh yeah, you're welcome. Mm. Mm. Hmm. I should have mentioned this um. As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case, it has a consistency of those stress balls. Mm. I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable, something that you can drop and it doesn't matter. 'Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls. Taped with duck tape and what have you, you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber. Mm. No. Yeah. My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote, yeah that's just an estimate though. I know. It's fun. I thought there was some flexibility with that. That's just off the top of my head, it is pending further emails. Right. It is the new it would be in a class of its own. It's true. We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on Yeah. I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically. It would be very nice. Yeah, 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function. I would have to side with that, I think the voice recognition is simpler, we already have the all the technology in-house, it's ready to go, it's packaged, it's Um, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind, but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up, but um, since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things? Okay. Um, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that, we should install a small backup battery. Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason, the remote hasn't been exposed to It's true. Yeah, it works about the same as a solar powered calculator, and you know how those those don't really require that much light, um, but obviously a little more light than a calculator, but we're not talking about a lot of light. Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything. Hmm. Why, why moving away from hand-held, why? What's the uh idea? Hmm. Do you think people that are people that buy a remote, are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes. Right. I think, I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote. Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good, even though and hand-held the same time. Yeah, those are nice. Mm. Okay. Right. Just kind of the squishy feel. Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost, I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and I'm just having to guess. Right. If, if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things. Yeah. Right. So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons? Rubber buttons? Um Right. Right. So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people? Or are we just going to go with one? ..It's very, it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously, but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm. It's a tough situation, but obviously having more cases also costs more so There's an idea. Right. Oh excellent yeah. That sounds good.
Mister participant two that is. Interesting question. Yes. Did you? I like it, I like it. Yes. Fabulous. We can have a duck tape casing. It could go with the granola crowd. Phew. Computer's adjusting. One moment please. So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer. So yur user interface, guys, is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear, or otherwise uh perceive. Uh, commands and mechanisms, that basically user uses to control the operator operating system. Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today. I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look. Um, so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts. Uh voice recognition, we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment. Um, so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples, um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control. Now our design team, research team, has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses. Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice, Good morning Joe. Um. In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control right. Um, another concept is what uh Apple has come up with, the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about. Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button, kind of like a modern a bit bulky, a bit crazy, I don't think that's we're necessarily going for. And uh some special components, uh ideas like uh blocking, having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue. Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here. Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose. Um, again probably not what we're going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas. Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line. Uh touch screen interface, um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen, uh, the important ones like power, volume and jump between channels. Um, and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power, um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not. And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready. And uh that is about it. Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects. You industrial designers. Where do you guys come up with these numbers? I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production, my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh Yeah. I mean I think that we really have two main selling points, I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest, we have the capa we have the design in-house, I mean we've we've come up with this, with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already. I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall. Sounds good. I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say. Does having both really up our costs? Well my p is Um, I definitely have to agree with that last comment. It's you and me outside a little here. Calculator. I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said. Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head. If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that, kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something. Just a thought. Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point. I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Think then we're hitting our cost issue again. I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command. Well what are we actually doing? What were Sure. And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme. Fabulous.
That went well, thank you. Perfect. Go ahead. Nice. Mm. Right. Right. Nice. Interesting. Mm. Good call. Choose it. Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints, is that really a feasible option? Right. Right. Um It's an option, uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand, it may help us decide for now. Temporarily anyway. I guess so, 'cause I found some interesting things. You waiting for me? I know, what a teaser ain't it. Um. Right. So current market trends. Screen. Um, basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields, to see sort of what's what's trendy, what's new, what's happening. Um, remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting they're sick of this boring, normal, functional, um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface. Um the challenge is that current trends right now, across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology, is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing. Now I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours, like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean, v line thing may be something we can look into. Different skin options, or if we can't afford this touch plate thing, or touch face screen interface um, maybe having the b images be specific, like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape or okay, not the example I would choose, but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy, uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like um, leather options or wood options or something Mm-hmm. Mm. Might be an interesting way to go. Um, yeah so something to sit on for now. So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding, everyone's looking for easy to use, technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. Um. Yeah. Um. Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue. True. Very true. Very true. Very much so. Um We could. I think that goes against the whole fancy something, a new line, but worth a shot. Ah, it could be, it could be, um. Yeah that's what I know. No problem. Mm. Yeah. Very true, very true. Mm. Hmm. Okay. Mm, right. Mm. Nice. Mm. Mm. I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places. But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be, that would be a really main cost source then right? Per? Piece. I know And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty? Do we remember? Okay. Can we justify it? Right. Though I think that's what people would pay for, I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote, you're gonna expect it to do something Yeah. Right. Yeah. See if we can cut some corners. Right. Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option, and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper. Right. It's a starting point anyway, so. Mm. Yeah 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote. I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely. Price-wise. True. We've already got it. Pretty much. Right and they said they wanted voice recognition. Course, maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option, but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups. Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent. But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model. Mm. Right. Right. And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either, we can stick with what we've already got. In a lot other ways too. I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option. So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right? Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement, like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably Yeah. True. True. Right. Okay. Uh Interesting. I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. True, and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people, like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too, right. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. With the bu yeah. Mm-hmm. True. Way to go. Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal, you know like that little pod looking thing? Right. That would be kinda neat. Terracotta bowl or something. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, which is the next big thing, so that's not gonna hurt us either. Right. Handy. Okay. Mm. Right. Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis, although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally then visually, like those shouldn't be Take precedence, yeah. Right. And they slide. Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options, in p True, we're still not making it easier then. True. Fair enough. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah it's just a scroll. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. Right. Mm. Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it, are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for. Mm. Right, particularly in technological fields, so that's exactly where we're headed. Uh. Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah, whatever. No, don't worry about it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, get in there. Yeah, totally. Cool. Cool.
That's great. Alright, let me just PowerPoint this up. Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design, don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is, it's just something important that we need to do. Um, think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete. In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype. Um. Right so um, apologies for the last meeting, it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough, um, so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting. Um, fair enough, thanks for the input, 's always good. Um. So, basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time, um, and gonna go through you, uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting, possible directions. And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work. So, perfect. So, without th further ado, whoever wants to go first is free to. Alright Nathan, take it away. It is Nathan right? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again? Good. Nice. Mm. Hmm. What kind of th thickness are we looking at? Okay, brilliant. Hmm. Hmm. M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like Yeah I like the idea, it's a good idea. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Can we do marketing piloting too? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received? Okay. Okay. Okay, perfect. Great, thank you very much Nathan. That's perfect, so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here. Fascinating, compelling even. Tomatoes. Slick, slick. Interface, oh the interface graphics for the um Yeah. Mm. Yeah, it's like, yep it's ubiquitous isn't it? Great, thanks for that Sarah. Ron? Yeah. Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the Mm. Mm. Yeah, I can see. Mm. Great. Great, wonderful Ron, cool. Lot of good ideas, good facts to have. That's what they need, it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time, just connect it, my kingdom. Right so, good to know all that stuff, thanks guys, um. Now we kind of have to come to some decisions, um, I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it. Um. Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think, I dunno, what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point? 'Kay. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. To produce each one. Mm. Hmm. Well. There is, it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money. Um, from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five. If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five. So From the board, um, well That's true, I mean And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know, mass sales anyway, we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things, we just couldn't, not for twenty-five Euros, so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five, sell 'em for thirty, but that's something that we can have finance deal with. Um, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron? Mm. No we could have a s very simple touch screen, you know, there's always the opportunity, if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever, you know, w we yeah, I guess we can play around with it a bit. Alright, let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here. So The voice rec thing, I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on, I think we might have to drop the voice rec. Yeah. Hmm. What do you think on it Nathan? About the voice rec? Mm. Yeah. I can't see how it wouldn't, I mean, there's you know the old aphorism, you can have it fast, you can have it cheap or you can have it quality, pick two of three. You know, you can't you can't have all three. It's just impossible. Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two. Um. Otherwise, yeah, we just it just becomes cost prohibitive. What which, which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to? 'Kay. What does the cost look like Ron? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen? Nathan? Mm. Right. Mm. Okay. So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em, the voice recognition will be better. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sorted. We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition. Yeah, well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step, it'll be a developing of prototype. Yes. We'll just run through it yeah, yeah, um. You discussed either a lithium or a solar power. Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition? Or this kinesthetic one, would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control? Mm. Mm. Yep. Right. Okay. What do you think Ron? Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Well we have to have buttons on it too as well. But that's done, that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it, Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers. I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing, it could still have the basic buttons on it. Um, 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well. And maybe a menu button and so forth, you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Still, I mean, yeah, along those lines. Yeah I like that, I like that idea a lot. Um, let's see what we can do as far as that goes. And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel, um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit. You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it. Mm 'kay. Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control. But to be fair, yeah, I mean, you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up. Yeah I like it, I like the idea, that's good. Um and we've sorted of discussed costs, um. I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing, if we run a bit over-budget, that might be okay, um. We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on. Um. And we just yeah go from there. Um, so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out, um, I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function, you know, not too complex. Like maybe have menu things. Mm. Yes. Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of, if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote, how do we yeah. B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there. Or you know, a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing, like on um like on a D_V_D_ player. You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that. Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um. Mm 'kay, um. We've already kind of covered this as well. That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market, um. Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. Um. Yeah alright, well, more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype. Right. I was just gonna step on to um I wasn't? Oh, my bad um sorry. The um, yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool? Um. Yeah. Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do, you could have uh a, you know, a um uh kind of a natural wood colour, like a stained wood and um, I don't know, olive green or something. That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing. Yeah, I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours. But yeah, stick with the same kind of kinda yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design. Cool. Alright, so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour, um. I want the uh I'd like Nathan, I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel, what can we accomplish, um, given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote. Um, what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype. And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple. Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place. Um, and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff. Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype, um using um prototype building materials um. And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well. So that's what to start with for now, is that alright, you guys feel clear about this? Alright. I guess we'll just hit the bricks. Thanks guys.

this meeting will be about the conceptual design , Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .
@highlight
apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
@highlight
basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .
@highlight
And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .
@highlight
basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .
@highlight
Um , components of a remote control , okay .
@highlight
We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells .
@highlight
Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere .
@highlight
Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility .
@highlight
Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .
@highlight
but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .
@highlight
Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood .
@highlight
Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .
@highlight
What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?
@highlight
Um , I imagine that we could specify .
@highlight
Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .
@highlight
touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .
@highlight
Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum .
@highlight
So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .
@highlight
So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .
@highlight
is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like I am sure that we could do that .
@highlight
just as a fun gimmick .
@highlight
Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .
@highlight
Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .
@highlight
we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?
@highlight
I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?
@highlight
Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer .
@highlight
My personal preference is uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .
@highlight
Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .
@highlight
Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .
@highlight
Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .
@highlight
Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .
@highlight
Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , Different skin options , and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls .
@highlight
I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .
@highlight
but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .
@highlight
I like the idea of of rubber too I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .
@highlight
So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive .
@highlight
Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system .
@highlight
Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today .
@highlight
the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts .
@highlight
Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control .
@highlight
our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses .
@highlight
Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .
@highlight
And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue .
@highlight
Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .
@highlight
Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .
@highlight
so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .
@highlight
Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .
@highlight
And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?
@highlight
I think it's our most marketable feature and all three of us can have a chat about it .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
But can we really afford it My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , that's just an estimate though .
@highlight
it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .
@highlight
Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?
@highlight
That's just off the top of my head , I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with .
@highlight
Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .
@highlight
let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here .
@highlight
I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , 'cause with voice recognition I think that our casing and the voice recognition I mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , I think we might have to drop the voice rec .
@highlight
I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .
@highlight
To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice What do you think on it Nathan ?
@highlight
About the voice rec ?
@highlight
I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .
@highlight
and they said they wanted voice recognition .
@highlight
Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition Does having both really up our costs ?
@highlight
I can't see how it wouldn't , so we have to pick between one of the two .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent .
@highlight
But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with I think the voice recognition is simpler , Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?
@highlight
Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better .
@highlight
We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .
@highlight
You discussed either a lithium or a solar power .
@highlight
Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ?
@highlight
Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , we should install a small backup battery .
@highlight
we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those don't really require that much light , I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .
@highlight
If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .
@highlight
Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?
@highlight
if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .
@highlight
if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .
@highlight
Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , we have to have buttons on it too as well .
@highlight
I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it .
@highlight
And maybe a menu button and so forth , use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote .
@highlight
I'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ?
@highlight
I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Terracotta bowl or something .
@highlight
And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit .
@highlight
something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .
@highlight
Just kind of the squishy feel .
@highlight
let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .
@highlight
um .
@highlight
I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .
@highlight
Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .
@highlight
although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , Like maybe have menu things .
@highlight
If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .
@highlight
we could do a slide or a compartment , Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player .
@highlight
we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ?
@highlight
Rubber buttons ?
@highlight
Um it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?
@highlight
because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but obviously having more cases also costs more you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .
@highlight
That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .
@highlight
let's work on uh multiple case colours .
@highlight
stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design .
@highlight
we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um .
@highlight
Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype .
@highlight
And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple .
@highlight
Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff .
@highlight
Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um .
@highlight
And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Project Update**

Uh, maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make? Yep. It's actually sitting, so it's sitting, it's not standing. Okay, I see it as one thing it's very supportive. It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog, it can be your best friend, it doesn't discriminate between you, based on what you are. Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition. dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Does it look like a dog actually? Mm. Eagle, okay. One point four or something like that. One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that. Yeah. Okay, pretty huge margin. So then Mm-hmm. Yeah, that c Okay, you wanna integrate everything into one like Okay. So simplification of symbols you could think of. Mm-hmm. Menu, alright. Uh uh Right, I was thinking on the same lines you, instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that, like a mobile, yeah and with menus. And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe. You mean to save it lesser number. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm, okay. S It might it might save a b bit of space, it's i instead of looking bulky, it might look small. But it might have its cost implications. Right. Okay. Mm, yeah.
Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better? Okay, that's fine. Am I supposed to be standing up there? Okay. Yeah, I've got Yes. Okay. Hello everybody. Um I'm Sarah, the Project Manager and this is our first meeting, surprisingly enough. Okay, this is our agenda, um we will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other. Um then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that, as far as I can understand. Now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know. Um, we want it to be original, something that's uh people haven't thought of, that's not out in the shops, um, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it. Okay, um, first is the functional design, um this is where we all go off and do our individual work, um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that. Um, conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's gonna go and then the detailed design, how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work. Okay, right. We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board, I'll go first, and um sum up the characteristics of that animal. So Okay, I'll leave space for everyone else. Um What's missing? We're running out of blue. Okay. I'm not gonna ask you to guess, I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. And I see them as majestic, and independent, and proud. Now, who would like to go next? 'Kay. Is that your lapel then? There you go. Okay, thank you. Okay. Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is um Gonna be a bird. Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird. That's lovely. Okay it's fine. Technical help. Hmm. Okay, yeah. A seagu right, not a seagull. Eagle. Mm-hmm. That's lovely. Okay. That was fun, right. Um finance-wise, we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros, which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds, at all. Any ideas? D fifteen? Seventeen. Okay, that's expensive. I think so, I think so, I'll be able to um pull it up, or I could put it in the shared folder or something. Really? Mm. I think Yeah, um production cost's at twelve fifty, so half of the selling price is taken up by building it. Um, and profit aim is fifty million Euros, which is uh Yi yes, um yeah, I presume so. Um Mm-hmm. No, yeah. So yes, yes, I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, um making that a key point, just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia, America, things like that. Okay. What are your experiences with remote controls? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos, a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls, um that you programme each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again. I think it was quite a cheapie as well, so that might have had something to do with it, but that was quite good, the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you. Mm. Yeah, the main that's the main stuff anyway, I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that. Yeah. Um. When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording, things like that inside it. 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at, it's obvious what you're doing, um. What about the older generation? What about granny and grandads? Um, my grandad can answer his mobile phone, but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. I don't think they tape things, I don't think they use Mm, yeah, the age gap. Mm. I don't know, I d I don't like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system. I find it really confusing, I kept getting lost in the phone, I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost, but that's just me. Yeah. Teletext has got that option as well. Yeah. Or what about kind of a dual function? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. Mm-hmm. I think that's a cost thing, I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about Yes, no that's important. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Um, right, okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting, so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation. Sure. Okay. Mm. I would it would probably. I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of moulded and look a bit different, and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic, which looks a bit smarter, so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about. Okay, so let's break it up there. Okay? So, see you in half an hour. I think so, yeah.
So we've got both of these clipped on? She gonna answer me or not? Right, both of them, okay. God. Jesus, it's gonna fall off. A kind of dog? Sorry? Uh. Mm-hmm. Please, please leave me a space at the bottom, I'm little, you can get to the top, with standing on a chair. I think it's outstandingly good. Crocodile? O Beauti that's Okay. Um, I'm very impressed with your artistic skills, mine's are dreadful. Oops this is now coming apart, let me just put the top in. I hope that clicks in, I'll just I'll hold it on, okay. Oops, oh dear, what happened there? Hopefully that'll stay on, two-handed version. Okay, uh Again this is off the top of my head, I was gonna do a big cat too, um. Oh dear, it doesn't look what like what I want it to be. Uh. It's not a vampire bat honestly. Uh and somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful that's the worst yet, that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull, I never thought of a seagull. An eagle, um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness. I suppose they're all so independent, I'd put that one down again. Da dum um. Indepen independent, right, did you say they're good at golf? Are they? Oh. Oh right, okay, I'm not good at golf. I'd say they're quite free-spirited, flying around everywhere, doing their own thing. And uh, birds of prey aren't they, oh dear, intrepid. I'll put that, intrepid. There we go, hope that pen's gonna be okay. Whoops. Seventeen. Seventeen Pounds. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later can't we? Yeah, okay. Okay. Right. So so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price, we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option? Mm. Mm-hmm. In our first year? Mm-hmm. You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market, any particular thing, it's everyone user-friendly to everyone. Okay. Big target group. No. Mm. Alright. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things. But basically on, off, volume up and down, channel one, two, th that basic functions, I don't think I could go any further with it than that, so, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. And symbols that you don't necessarily understand, symbols you're meant to understand that you don't. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Actually that just raises a point, I wonder what our design people think, but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display, I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful, so you've got a little L_C_D_ display. With menus, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too? Right. Right. So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with, that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps, and that's another issue how we tackle that. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books? Obviously it displays less on the screen, it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top, your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, like smaller. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know? Something that's easily moulded and produced. Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys. Ah right. Okay. Sure b y yeah. But yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be that, you know th that was my main point, we don't have to use metal, I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Okay. 'Kay. Do we go back to our room? Yep?
It's sitting down. Yeah I'll have a go. Thanks. Alright, okay. Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do, I'll have to have to go for something a bit random. And also, my drawing skill isn't that great so, yeah. Okay, now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now, so. Yeah, it can be a crocodile, it can be a crocodile. Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually. Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is. Um uh scary, uh strong, yeah that's about it I think. Uh uh Wo Hmm. Okay. Uh S Uh Okay, some sort of bird. Ah eagle, right okay. They're good at golf. Yeah, no yeah, an eagle. It's about mm, mm yeah. Yeah, yeah, something like that, so that yeah about seventeen, seventeen Pounds, something like that. But Havi having said that though, if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway. So, it'd still be yeah, we had to buy one. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah uh. Use all the ones at the same time. Yeah, 'cause you Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext, so. Yeah. Yeah, what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing, 'cause I mean, menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. But I don't know how Oh yeah. Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume. Y Yeah. No uh uh Yeah. Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics, so I think think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .
@highlight
Um and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .
@highlight
about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ?
@highlight
I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , I mean you don't you you can still have plastic we don't have to use metal , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .
@highlight
They're kind of moulded so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .
@highlight
So , see you in half an hour .
@highlight
Okay , so let's break it up there .

ES2008d.json,"Okay um, welcome to our detailed design meeting. I'm pretty excited. Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that. Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting, what we d discussed um, then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria. We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close. So, starting off with the um last the last one, oh I don't have it here um, but we talked about energy, we're gonna use a kinetic battery um, we want to use a simple chip, because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um, we're gonna need a scroll um, we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu. And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels. Okay? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first. like a little lightning in it. The little lightning bolt in it, very cute. The v the rhombus rhombus? Um on, off? Okay. Yeah we turn it off. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh. Very interesting. I think that one's my favourite. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Now that was one thing that we brought up over email. I don't know if you picked up your email, but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost. Mm-hmm. It's really Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno, you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off? Do you think that would be conceptually possible? Mm-hmm. Mm. That's true, mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay, that's a fair evaluation. Getting lost. Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. Okay 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out, but um Mm-hmm. Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function? Sure. Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria, if you've developed some? Oh okay. Okay. Okay. Do you need this or just write on the white board? Okay. It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing, you know, kinda push it. 'Kay. Maybe a little smaller than that. Oh it does, it's kind of like There it could have a stem like that, 'cause I do l kind of like the stem. Yeah. It almost helps you ge keep a grip too, 'cause it goes in between fingers. I like this one. Variety of colours are nice. I think I'm leaning towards the potato. Mm-hmm. I am worried about like um using a menu. Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus, and so how do you get back to the main menu? But that has a menu button separate from a select button, whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button? Okay. Could these be used for going to submenus or Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still, mm 'kay. I think so. I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two. Okay. I will give it a one. Um functional. I think it'll get everything done, I think it might be a little confusing at first, um, I don't know if that's gonna be a later one. Okay, then I'm gonna give it a two. Did you give a functional? Okay. Well, the kinetic battery. But they'll notice it after like a year, they'll be like hey, I have never changed the battery. Mm. Just the material. Think I'm gonna go with the four as well. I really like that kinetic battery though. Mm 'kay. Uh let's say two. Give it a one. Mm. 'Cause there would be less impact maybe,. That's right, yeah, corporate colour, we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black, and a design in and the outside in yellow, that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours, one a more conservative one, one that's more fruity. Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something? Okay. Fruity, so fruity. I think i it's kind of mangoey too. Yes. Mm. One. Mm-hmm. Yes. It's gonna be hard. And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing, but um I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think I'd give it a four too. It's a pretty high learning curve, it'll be easy once you've done it, but We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour, but Mm-hmm. Mm I'd give it a four. Small too. Three. It's totally fashionable. I'd give it a one. Mango. I do like uh the little Martian one. One. Mm-hmm. I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements. Um yeah, that's good. So I'll give it a a two. Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo, so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it. All of them should have R_R_, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Lovely. Okay, now we're gonna look at finances. Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um, so let me exit out of this first. Okay um I know. Let me one more space. Gonna zoom in real quick. Okay. Hand dynamo. We're using kinetic battery, right? Um and we're having one per One, okay. Um electronics. Simple. Mm 'kay. Um the case. It's very curvy, so okay. The wood? I mean the rubber. Mm-hmm, okay. Yeah, we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours. Um. I dunno where it yeah. So let's y say three. Yeah, I dunno. That I thi I thought that would be under yours. We'll just say three. Mm-hmm. Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well, so yeah. Interface, we're doing push buttons. And how many buttons do we have? Six. Anything else? Oh, buttons oh, so um. So the case material will just have one colour, right, but then the buttons will be in special colours? We're saying per unit. Okay, so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours, 'cause that how it's designed there. So Special form? They're all kind of just push button, right? Special material? Uh. Oh do I have to do it per button, do I? Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Thirteen point seven. Yeah, what can we reduce? Let's see what that would do. It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway. Okay um, are we sure this is double-curved? Maybe it's single-curved, we have no idea. Well it's not the yeah. Okay, it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive, but we have a simple chip, single curve, case material is rubber and it's a special colour, but that's important. Six buttons we have to have six buttons. What? No, okay, maybe not. I don't know what just happened. Now it's twelve. Twelve point five. So we're okay, I think. Yeah. Okay, we're all set. Um save. I saved that to our um our big shared folder, so you know. Um okay, back to agenda. Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro? Yes. Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means, any new ideas found. So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got on the news, how we used it, if we were able to um, you know, use our creativity with the information, um how how well I guess I led it, um the how well we worked together as a team, um the digital pens, the whiteboard. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think we all made um very significant contributions, I don't think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good, like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over, um I like our little finished products. Really cute. I know, let's think of it like a little jingle. Um.. Okay um new ideas found? Definitely. Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm etcetera. Oh, I'm so excited. Mm-hmm. I thi yeah, that's awesome. Um okay, closing. Are the costs within the budget? Is the project evaluated? Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary. Um so, this is the great product kids, I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it, um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um yeah. Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and. I do like the Martian remote. If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice. Although the tog toggle I'm afraid I would It's cool. I think I would break it. Oh yeah, it's kind of a penguin. Mm-mm. Mm 'kay, congratulations. Um. Anything else to say? Alright. Um anybody have I got more master classes, anybody else wanna like take a master's class? Yeah, but check it out. So like there are all these like links, they don't go anywhere. But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management. Um just wanna make sure you do. Oh It is. Yes definitely I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website.. Wow. Yes. I love Excel, it's one of my favourite programs. I see, mm. Spongy. I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing. We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool. Mm-hmm. No. Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me I Mm. Mm-hmm. And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at, like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here, did you work together or did you like do separate projects? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Cool. Oh thanks. It's kinda fun. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. This is what we'll do. I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time not quite enough, you know what I mean, like we we couldn't answer every single question. Um but Mm. It was interesting what came out like later, like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um, that more points came out from your presentation even. Um. I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote, because that was kind of a big point. About yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Considered the re yeah. Well it's interesting that they Mm-hmm, yeah. It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that. I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep, but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is, but Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. It d yeah, it depends on how organised you are personally, but Mm-hmm. Oh. Can't get in. Yep. We should make one that walks by itself. Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet, that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there. Well, but if you could attach them to the T_V_, then you can. Mm. Okay. Sorry, I'm just um trying to update my minutes. I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary, rather than like repeating them. Just gonna make I'm making full minutes, so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that. 'Cause that seems a little more useful. But I didn't have like information to sloth through either, so Most of it, mm-hmm. I added slides, um I added a couple slides each time, but that was about it. Mm. Well, the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points, but it wouldn't have a slide for each point. And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point. I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do and so I had it once, even if it was just like the title of it, like the three presentations, and I would do your three. The slogan on it? No no no. I think we just need the um the R_R_, yeah. Yeah, I was just kinda going by the web page, 'cause they didn't give me any clear, like yellow, grey, or. I don't really like yellow in general. But it Wasn't it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um the marketing choices, you know, like that was a bit of a conflict. People are stupid. Maybe, like I don't know. That could always be. Oh. I'm claiming it intellectual property.
Right, well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one. Um we have our colours not are not fixed, but this is the general shape. Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand. You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone, or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand, or even I mean there's a whole variety, you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger. Uh we have the on off button at the tip, very visible, very big. We have our up and down buttons, which are also gonna be our channel selectors, and we have our little menu button here. If you push if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons, if uh the volume buttons rather. If you press select once, they become channel changing buttons. If we press select three times, the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up, and you have your five presets down here. Um if people wanna grab hold of that, see how it feels in your hand. That's our number one prototype. Um do you wanna present the potato, or shall I present the Martian? That's the rhombus, yep. If you pressed and held it maybe. Yeah. On off, that's a possibility, yeah. And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear, either way. Um it's a bit different, just a little bit more of a creative feel. Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top. We have the five preset seeds. And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional, you have your channel changing, volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle. So, that's for your consideration as well, plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up. We figured it could stand up like this on your table, if you wanted it to, if I made the bot the bottom flat. Uh the menu select button. We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours, but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man, for an example customer, might not want a fruity coloured remote, so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down, maybe with with less contrasts on it. Yeah, something still a little bright to make it hard to lose, but yeah. Right. Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen. So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss I think Yeah. There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon. So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality? Um. Mm yeah, that's good, that's good. Here, stick it on. So where Right. Okay. Ooh. Hey. No, I kinda like it. That's hard to miss. Like Yeah. Interesting. Okay, is that where people are leaning then, the potato? I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down, that one. Hmm. Well that on the iPod, for example, you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level. Good point. Maybe yeah, maybe it can be one of those, if you press down and hold for two seconds, then it brings you back one level or something. The potato? Are we leaning towards the potato? Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um I dunno if it's it's creative. I dunno if fancy is the word I would use. I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two, because c unique. Yeah, one. In the battery, that's it. How many people would notice that, though? Yeah. I I would say that it's Yeah, like fancy versus creative it's it's different. But does that equal innovative? I dunno. I'll give it a three. Okay. Um I'll give it a one. Pretty hard to mess up. Yeah. Ooh, that you couldn't it'd be harder to break, harder to lose. Mm. It it might be, 'cause that's our corporate colour, isn't it? We might wanna keep it yellow. Yeah. If we had a yellow Sure. So it was inspired by the potato, so I think it's pretty fruity. Oh, mango that that That's a much more trendy than a potato one. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll say two as well. Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first, but The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing, but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out, but you'll have it afterwards. So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess. Oh, good point. Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three, I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally. Simple to use or simple in design? Do you know? Right. I'm give it a three I guess. I dunno. I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was. Um two. Yeah. Yeah, I'll say two. Shall we uh Well I think all of them should have an R_R_. Oh my. Uh we're n using kinetic, yeah. Yeah. Single. Simple, simple rather. Uh uh uh double-curved. Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know. Our case material supplements oops, we just skipped by them. No, we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed. The supplement is Oh, I guess it was rubber rather than latex. Yeah. Uh well I don't know what the se the basic colour is though. Well, are we talking about on each colour combination or are we, you know, we'll like we'll have yellow and black. Is that two special colours? Or or is white and black, then two more or Uh. I guess it's three, three three. Alright. Yeah. Six, with the power. Yeah. No. Oh, we'll do we wa Are the buttons in special colour, special f I didn't get information on Well, does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused. per unit, okay, okay. Alright, and each button s Yeah, okay. No, I think they're fine. Material, we want them rubber as well probably, yeah. No, I don't think so. I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh oh. Okay, let's have our buttons all be one colour. Alright. Uh. We have no idea. I dunno, I didn't get any pictures. It's single curved. Why not? Yeah. That is important. How did it get more expensive, what did you just change? It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen. Twelve point five. Hey hey. We're all set then. Ish. Alright. Yes. Well. I felt very creative. I enjoyed making the prototypes. Yeah. I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information, like what's a single-curved case, how many colours, what do colours count things, but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. Um I think we worked together pretty well. Yeah. But the fruits and vegetables, they really my creativity, so. Do you think we could Yeah. Yeah. Can we market this as the mango remote? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging? I have a little R_R_. Yes. Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget. All thanks to Iain for the design of that one. Mm. What did we find for new ideas? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables. I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them. That was I I knew you can get watches that had them, like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery, 'cause you're always moving your wrist. But in other things, I think it'd be really good. Yes. Yeah. It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright, so Is it started as a pear, but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the Take me to your leader. Wow, maybe I should market it to some remote control company now. So are are poor little thing. Oh. It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails. Let's see, what did I get through the corporate website? It's just inspiration about circuit boards. Yeah, that is pretty neat. Yeah, my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit, talking about circuit boards. I learned a lot actually. I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to. Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down, because I thought it would be relevant, like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control, but then they're like, you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case. It's really interesting though. Yeah. That was really neat how I got emails and No. I yeah. If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case, the different looks of the case, I would have probably drawn them up, but Yeah, we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it, but with only four people it doesn't really make sense. I think if you had a larger group Yeah. Because we're all gonna be working in different places. We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time, then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright, but everyone needs their own, like specific notes, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So it was a bit of both really, we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey, mangoey shape, and then just went from there really. It was fun. So well done with the management, I felt well managed. That happened to me all the time though. Yeah, I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions, but we were able to do it regardless, so. I'm not usually a very decisive person, so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes. Especially last time, yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. Right. And I I felt the first two meetings, that I was coming in with no information, and not sort of made me really like, ooh I don't know, throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite. I had so much information and so much to talk about. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like Yeah. I think we were Yeah. I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task. I think we really got into it, I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like, ooh I'm designing a remote control, I dunno if that's just me, but Yeah. Yeah. I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them. I dunno. I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least, there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs. Yeah. Yeah, or like I guess what the setup of the house is too. But, I mean I am notorious for losing my keys, I just I guess I've just never lost the remote. I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them. 'Cause I was putting groceries away. You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room. Can't get in, look all around the kitchen. Definitely in the vegetable drawer. So. Mm. But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much. Yeah. Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot, alien, pear, whatever he is, have a little voice like, I am located Oh a G_P_S_ system, internal G_P_S_. Although if it's sitting still for too long. Yes I Or little Or just just a wheel, you know. Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote, that'll. zoom Yeah. Hmm. All kinds of possibilities. Yeah. Oh. Wow. 'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do. Yeah, I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you, every meeting. Oh. Okay. Yeah, I didn't even think about adding slides, 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more. Ah yeah.. Right. No, no, definitely not. We No, I don't think we need to I think the R_ and R_, especially if the yellow and black one. Or yellow and blue. Lemme go to the web page. Finish meeting now. Yeah. I guess it i it sort of a grey, isn't it? Yellow and grey, but then the slogan's in blue. Yeah. Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway. Well we're not, sadly, going to actually be producing this, so. Potato mango shaped remotes. I can't believe a whole day is gone. I don't feel like it's been that long. Get sucked in. Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet.
Right, do you wanna start? Okay, um What We call that one the rhombus, uh the rhombus. Um this one is known as the potato, uh it's it's a how can I present it? It's an ergonomic shape, so it it fits in your hand nicely. Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand. Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one. Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume. So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here. Um the red ones are for uh changing channels, channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected. Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it, that's the potato. Uh that would be one of your channels, basically, so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off, yeah. Um not really, it would make it hard to turn the machine off, to turn your T_V_ off. Yeah yeah, that that'd be one way of doing it, yeah. That'd work, yeah. Let's pass. So that's So that's our three prototypes. Um basically, in terms of making decisions, what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want, then decide what kind of button layout we want, how many buttons, and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device, like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever. Would Yeah, but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy. Yeah. I think it would be difficult technologically, because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it, s so it's I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. Uh I mean ho how many times do you really, seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it? Yeah, it's possible, yeah, yeah. Put an extra the button on. Cool. It makes look more fruity as well. It's like a deformed foot, I dunno. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is, it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices. You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh. Yeah. Yeah, so they're used for going into and out of your submenus, yeah. Potato. I'll go for two. I think it's it's functional, it's also pretty basic, so I'll give it a two. I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique, I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um, so I I'd give it a four. I'll say one. I wonder if it bounces when you drop it. Yeah. Yeah I'd I'd give it a one. Uh um. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Mangoey is better, yeah. I like mangoes. Uh two. Uh one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah I'll I'll say two. I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn, because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first, but once you've, yeah once you'd learned how to use it, I think it is a lot easier. So I'd I'd give it a four. Yeah. Yeah. Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that, yeah. I'll give it a two. Three. Guess it's double-curved. It is pretty curvy. Special colours, isn't it? We've got five. Oh six. Yeah. Yeah. What was our target price again? Twelve point five. So we're just just about there. Yeah. I think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. That's cool. Let's all let's all go for the yellow Break the stem off. That was bound to happen Mm. Yeah. I think. Yeah. We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much. Yeah. Uh we we worked together, um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work, um and how we could like improve on the on the design. I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time, and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings. And I I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided. But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings, so that we we knew where to go on from there. Yeah. Yeah, for some of the meetings, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I could Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button? If you like held it down, that would be on off. Sorry, what's the yellow one in the middle, I forgot. But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it. I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun, even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to, just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different. I sort of like this one, like I I don't know why, it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking, I dunno. But I also like the b the side buttons on that one, like I think that's kind of neat. But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable, sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on. Ah, there we go. Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for. That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard, so. No, I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing, 'cause I think it would be redundant. I dunno. Okay, so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities, the yellowy one is that Okay, well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one. So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to. So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that. So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all, or false, if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria. So we can do this one first. First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective. So like in my opinion the for now at least, the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three. That's just my opinion. What does each of you Okay, well give it a number, sorry. Okay. And two, awesome. Alright, and same sort of scale for functionality, is it functional? I think it's extremely functional, I'm gonna give it a one. One? Okay. Okay. Well there's some other ones, I will address that, yeah. Awesome, okay. Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative. Yeah, she said it was one. Um is it technologically innovative? Mm. Not really, I mean not so much, 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen, we don't have fancy chip. Other than what it looks like, I dunno if it's really I kinetic battery is a big one, so. Mm. But it but we know it's there. And if it's made of like latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool. I'll give it a three. 'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really Alright. Everyone else? Mm 'kay. Next, is it easy to use? Just so you know, easy to learn will be separate, so don't overlap them. I think it's really easy to use. I'll give it a two. Alright. Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Iain, what do you give it? Alright and the next is, does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables? Well, is it gonna be yellow? Yeah, but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something. Oh, yeah. Alright, so I think it it's Yeah. Yeah. I okay, I'm giving it a one the mango put me over. What are what's everyone's numbers? Alright um, and does the design match the appropriate behaviour? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons, that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most. I think we really took that into account a lot, so I'm gonna give it a one. Did you say one, Rose? Okay um, also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account? I think I'll give it a two, 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do, something is gonna happen. Um um worth the risk, I think. 'Kay. Alright, awesome. And the ease of learning it. I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that, I dunno. It sort of reminds me of the iPod. I just got mine, I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay, so and I'm not good at learning technology. So I'll give it a two. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright, um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all, so Okay, so in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four, 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it, you're kind of not gonna find it, but anywhere else it's gonna stand out. Alright, we also said simplicity, how w how well does it address just being simple? I think overall, 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion, so those are the next two things we're gonna look at. Separate from fancy, like that sort of thing. Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple, so I'm gonna give it a two. Alright, and fashionable? It's hot, I mean it's a mango, come on. I mean how fashionable can you make a remote? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well. Yeah, the toggle on off switch, it's really appealing. Number. And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal, that whole thing? Just that it would se serve our audience. I don't see why not. Mm-hmm. Alright, did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about? And so we're gonna do that, so it will address it, fine. Okay. That's me. Whoa. Simple. Yeah. Well don't we need plastic, and Provided, okay. It was rubber and special colour, right? Do we have more than one special colour? Per Well, but we know that we're having at least three colours, so Right. We have six. Oh no, five. Oh wait. Yeah. Yeah, per unit. Yeah. I like it like that. Yeah, 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise, 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one. It's I mean it's two to make it rubber. Oh wait, so maybe. Mm, I kind of like the buttons. It's single curved. We Yeah, they are. Yeah, I mean if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could've taken that into account. I know, I really did, the the whole mango idea was great. No, I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally, like its heaviness, and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages, I dunno. That was a bit of a distraction. That was the last one, like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to, so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing. They're funny. I kind of want one. I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there. I like the R_R_, that's gonna be etched in. Yeah, I didn't even know they existed. Yeah, Real Reaction. Oh, that would definitely be my second choice. I would break it. I would break it. Oh that's funny. Kind of looks like a penguin, like with no eye. I like that it stands up. Oh, sad. Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over, its all timed. Oh. No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us? It's very it's very work relevant, 'cause people send spam a lot. Oh here you can you can view. You can just see what's up. Yeah it's it's really deep. Hold on. Takes a little while to get excited to load. That the Excel thing is pretty cool. Here, like, basically it's like inspiration, basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing, see. You didn't miss out that much. Oh wow. This one was cooler. I got a whole table and everything. That's like mine it was like, would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control? And then it didn't have like any kind of table, like awesome, I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result. Yeah. 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually, like whiteboards are good, you know like crossing out ideas, or like if we had had like a brainstorming period. But I thought we were good orally. Get crazy. And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here, 'cause we all needed them separately, kind of on the whiteboards in this room. Yeah. Sorry. Well the problem was, even when we just were creating from the Excel file, there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included, so there was no we could be like yeah, it has it included. There was no way for us to have written down that it was really there. Yeah. That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys, and I always do, anyway. You'll lose 'em in your pocket, like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember, there's always ways to lose things. That's funny. That's funny. I always do that, leaving it in my coat, and then like using a different coat. Yeah. Can't really take it into the other room. Oh man. Here you go. That really could get up and walk away. You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like Okay good. 'Cause I was like, it could go around the outside. Is it yellow and blue? Oh I guess it is black, grey. Grey is better than black, doesn't look so bumblebeeish. Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings. Yes. I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation, you wouldn't just have like one set of source, it's kind of an they were so not backed up, it would just be a sentence like we did a survey, this is what people said. S mm, I dunno. Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons, we're good. If they ever come out with potato I'm gonna have to Yeah. I know.
@highlight
welcome to our detailed design meeting .
@highlight
and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria .
@highlight
and finally a do a production evaluation we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu .
@highlight
we made three different prototypes our colours not are not fixed , Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .
@highlight
We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here .
@highlight
If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather .
@highlight
If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons .
@highlight
That's our number one prototype .
@highlight
The little lightning bolt in it , very cute .
@highlight
We call that one the rhombus , Um this one is known as the potato , It's an ergonomic shape , Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one .
@highlight
Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume .
@highlight
So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here .
@highlight
Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?
@highlight
it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off .
@highlight
And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way .
@highlight
Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel .
@highlight
Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top .
@highlight
And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up .
@highlight
We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat .
@highlight
in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .
@highlight
we were we were talking about that a little bit and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house .
@highlight
It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen .
@highlight
So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ a little light beep goes off ?
@highlight
um that when you press it I think it would be difficult technologically , and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else .
@highlight
There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .
@highlight
Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now .
@highlight
'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , I sort of like this one , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ?
@highlight
Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .
@highlight
I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .
@highlight
It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , It makes look more fruity as well .
@highlight
There it could have a stem like that , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ?
@highlight
Variety of colours are nice .
@highlight
I think I'm leaning towards the potato .
@highlight
that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .
@highlight
I am worried about like um using a menu .
@highlight
withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?
@highlight
on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again But that has a menu button separate from a select button , the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices .
@highlight
Could these be used for going to submenus maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .
@highlight
Potato .
@highlight
some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .
@highlight
what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective .
@highlight
in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three .
@highlight
I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two .
@highlight
I dunno if fancy is the word I would use .
@highlight
and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ?
@highlight
I think it's extremely functional , I think it'll get everything done , then I'm gonna give it a two .
@highlight
Um is it technologically innovative ?
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , the kinetic battery .
@highlight
How many people would notice that , though ?
@highlight
And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool .
@highlight
Think I'm gonna go with the four as well .
@highlight
Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way .
@highlight
Give it a one .
@highlight
and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ?
@highlight
is it gonna be yellow ?
@highlight
We might wanna keep it yellow .
@highlight
I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity .
@highlight
Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ?
@highlight
it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity .
@highlight
I think i it's kind of mangoey too .
@highlight
That's a much more trendy than a potato um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ?
@highlight
Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , so I'm gonna give it a one .
@highlight
also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing .
@highlight
Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ?
@highlight
I think I'll give it a two , And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , And the ease of learning it .
@highlight
The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards .
@highlight
So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess .
@highlight
because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , So I'd I'd give it a four .
@highlight
also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , how w how well does it address just being simple ?
@highlight
Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , I'm give it a three I guess .
@highlight
and fashionable ?
@highlight
It's totally fashionable .
@highlight
I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well .
@highlight
And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ?
@highlight
if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements .
@highlight
So I'll give it a a two .
@highlight
we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it .
@highlight
I think all of them should have an R_R_ .
@highlight
now we're gonna look at finances .
@highlight
Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um , We're using kinetic battery , Simple .
@highlight
Guess it's double-curved .
@highlight
don't we need plastic , and It was rubber and special colour , we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours .
@highlight
I don't know what the se the basic colour is though .
@highlight
like we'll have yellow and black .
@highlight
Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , And how many buttons do we have ?
@highlight
We have six .
@highlight
the case material will just have one colour , but then the buttons will be in special colours ?
@highlight
Special form ?
@highlight
I think they're fine .
@highlight
Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah .
@highlight
Thirteen point seven .
@highlight
what can we reduce ?
@highlight
let's have our buttons all be one colour .
@highlight
Maybe it's single-curved , It's single curved .
@highlight
case material is rubber and it's a special colour , It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen .
@highlight
Now it's twelve .
@highlight
What was our target price again ?
@highlight
Twelve point five .
@highlight
So we're okay , I think .
@highlight
Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ?
@highlight
Yes .
@highlight
Let's move on to the project evaluation .
@highlight
Project process .
@highlight
Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found .
@highlight
So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard .
@highlight
I felt very creative .
@highlight
I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes .
@highlight
I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well .
@highlight
if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account .
@highlight
I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , Mm .
@highlight
What did we find for new ideas ?
@highlight
People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .
@highlight
I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them .
@highlight
Is the project evaluated ?
@highlight
Yes .
@highlight
there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary .
@highlight
this is the great product kids , and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results I do like the Martian remote .
@highlight
If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .
@highlight
Although the tog toggle I would break it .
@highlight
I would break it .
@highlight
Is it started as a pear , Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye .
@highlight
Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , otherwise the technology today was kinda cool .
@highlight
I got more master classes , what did I get through the corporate website ?
@highlight
It's just inspiration about circuit boards .
@highlight
the Excel thing is pretty cool .
@highlight
I I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .
@highlight
I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .
@highlight
We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .
@highlight
Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .
@highlight
we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .
@highlight
when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?
@highlight
Uh we we worked together , we sort of made different shapes well done with the management , I felt well managed .
@highlight
I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , It's kinda fun .
@highlight
we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .
@highlight
I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .
@highlight
But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , like we we couldn't answer every single question .
@highlight
And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , Um .
@highlight
I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote , Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that .
@highlight
How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , Most of it , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one .
@highlight
I think we just need the um the R_R_ , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or .
@highlight
I guess it is black , grey .
@highlight
I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source ,","**Meeting Agenda: TV Remote Control Project Update**

ES2004c.json,"Oops. Mm. After lunch. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Yep. 'Kay. Yep. Fine. It's okay with me. Yep. Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space. Uh Right. Night. And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery, it like it runs for long time? Mm-hmm. Okay. We c Solar would be slightly expensives. It's twelve point f Another question is like sorry. W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day. A remote control, like, so we have to s look at the life also. Okay. So Mm-hmm. Okay. Second thing is yeah and second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever. So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that. So is that feature available in like uh titanium, or it's like only specific to plastic or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Something like Alright. That could be a good idea. It could it would be comfortable to hold on also. Sorry I didn't get the last part, you're talking of Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely, you're saying like Uh-huh. Okay. 'Kay. Absolutely, f for somebody who very often, if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like, if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever. And just one small question before like you are, regarding the circuit, since we are hav having a flip-top, we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing, so we can divide the circuit like you know. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay, uh would like to share something which I did here. First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh, people need trendy, they are bored of black and white. So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard. Like, some some people have a Here you see this? This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control, rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all. Okay, and second as already discussed with William, we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever, which is Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface. So basically not point or click Press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify. And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device, that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer. So we are having a combination of boards, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels. But Mm-hmm. Okay and you mean to the And the lower distance. Oh f perfect. So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and in inconsistent. Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it. So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here. Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also? And technologically innovative also. So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like, as already uh marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, uh red chilli uh tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have, like for example, i if you see the previous slide uh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls. This is central one, the one you yeah volume and channel. So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models, if you look at all the models, it's here. This and voice recognition. The kinetic. Mm-hmm. Maybe we could start with the black and white. That that way we could upgrade later. Mm. Mm. Yeah. And for the sorry. For the body design I think plastic, uh w yeah we could use the body, for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip, something like to add to the design. Plast right. It's Uh I it's different. Right. Acupressure, you could talk of acupressures. And finally the body should be retouchable, may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside, it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time. Okay. The rubber. Fine. Yeah. Fine, uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost. So, are we looking at voice? Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains. For l yeah, the whistle. So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. Yep. Uh sorry I didn't mention this, but we'll be incorporating in the design. Fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Again a questionnaire huh? I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.
I'll wait until you're all um hooked up. Okay. Put it on in that way. Thanks. Okay. Welcome back everybody, hope you've had fun. Right um this is our conceptual design meeting, um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting, I th I I think yeah um. This is where we talk about um properties, materials, user-interface and trend-watching. So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already, but we'll just go over it. Um the minutes from the last time. Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal, um. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost, things like that, um and our market was going to be young, business, kind of range. Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation? Yes if you feel It's okay. Yeah. Okay thank you very much. Um let's start from the inside and work our way out. I don't think so, not yet. Um, yes, thank you. I hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them. Okay. 'Kay.. 'Kay. Wa can you explain that? Like a right, okay. How what kind of how l long can you get out of that, I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Or That doesn't count though does it? I thought it was U_V_ like Any, any I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Uh, I don't think it counts electric lights no, but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market. I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people, but there are people. Mm, but then it would be charging through the day, I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening. Okay. Yeah I've seen But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around, you're doing things, it is moving a lot of the time. If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side. Is it really gonna be enough? Okay. So it's not the draw on it isn't Okay. Like a dual kind of. Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest? Solar. Well they're not designed Practical-wise okay. You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well? Mm. Okay, can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature? Can we think about that? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's Well add it in to think about um because, where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much. But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls. No. Okay. Okay, right. Mm-hmm. What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hinged, yeah. So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber, like those pens that you get with the grip, that you can you can pull that off. Okay. Mm. Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh it would be flat inside. Mm. I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside. Now how would you distinguish, if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press, I mean Uh Like one of the palm pop thing. It would have to be attached. Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that. That's you, right okay. No. We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women. Well it's a remote control, you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ Yeah, no, no. Mm. Okay. Okay, okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Which means Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone. Yeah. That's what I was just saying, and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls, so have the um the volume and the programme, things like that, on the lower side. Okay. I can't see that, is that play and stop and things? Or is that volume and channel? Okay. Right. Okay. Um I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery? Yeah. Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, you know that it sits in, then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget, it's a selling point. I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things. The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Yeah, okay. And you could yeah. Okay. Do you want like a back-up? Um, okay so we've got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? So there's not a really a decision to be made there, um. The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or On the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then Okay, okay. No, it's fine. For the inside. Mm-hmm. Oh I think so, I think so. No I think I we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, you know, we could make it black and white zebra stripes, but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the m you know yes. So we could just pick anything. It's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean, I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses, sort of beige and black um so you either want something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway, or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and Mm. And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do, you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little Mm. And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know, you could just go so far with it, like a puffer fish, you could just, you could take it wherever, so I think that's quite a flexible thing. Yes. Mm. Yeah. Okay we've got five minutes, um, or that might've been up for a while. Mm-hmm. Have you Okay. Well they do, but I think we can you could well it is, it is, I think you just address that with um advertising. Um, you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you. Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does, without that so I'm not worried about that. Depending on how i I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into, so um that seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else, then it's worth thinking about. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards. Right I'm going to wrap it up there. I got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so. Um so I think we've probably got it says, closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back. It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took. Is everyone happy? Okay.
Yeah, yeah I was getting that impression as well. Etcetera. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. That screwed in? Yeah. 'Kay, Okay. Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay, first uh the Into the method. The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials, 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. Um, findings, I've got my nice little picture there. This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment. Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options. There's um actually no rechargeable option available, so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest, people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. It might You Yeah, yeah, oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long, but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options, like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_. No. Is it? Alright i Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up. Yeah, okay. But Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it. I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work. Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery, 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches. And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out. Yeah. Yeah and Yeah but then again I I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side. And th for the same the same reason, you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be Mm. Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because, if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical. They're they're expensive, they don't Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones, um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping, 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so. Y I think yeah, practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do, they can t Yeah they do, they yeah they've got dual things, but they're the batteries are smaller I think. Mm. W m yeah so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging, um, I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last. Yeah I think i I think it would, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, well I'll move on. Um, my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts. Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in. If you if you see how thin the tracks are, you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one, if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that, or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then to uh yeah, so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote, but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up. Um, the case material, I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium um very expensive just to process, which to make it is expensive, and rubber, well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year, so perhaps uh some something made of rubber, but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_. I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone. Yeah. Yeah I th Uh. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really, the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote. Yeah, yeah. Rubber, yeah. And you can peel them off yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. T Yeah. Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen. Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough, that would be one option. Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons, but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space, two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch display. Uh what what Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it, but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off, you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board. With W also with the Yeah. You could have a flat screen inside, yeah, but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside. It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white, but there'd be touch touch buttons, so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em, w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_. Is rubber. Mm. Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest. Yeah you could, you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost, 'cause I had Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple, I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them, 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking. Mm. Um. Yeah. I mean you can you could do it, you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out, but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it, I'm not sure about Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah but you can do it with your thumb li Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah we Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah I think I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them, uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them. So do you reckon that's a good idea that, where's the remote, I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one, I mean they use them in calculators so. Yeah. Well you cou um. K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. So it's a lot smaller, so it would Yeah. Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah. On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, the anti-R_S_I_ ones. Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. Plastic, okay. Yeah. Mm no. Mm. You can you can just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case, just the rubber thing that goes round the outside. Oh yeah, yeah the whistle ones, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, depending on the expense of it. And they've got in stock, so yeah. Yeah. Okay. Did it?
Oh good grief. 'Kay. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Shall I? Okay. We just connect up. Thank you. There we go. Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch, sorry Project Manager. Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at. Okay, um, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, uh again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan. Be interesting to see what our design people make of that. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Not yet? 'Kay. Okay. I know. Does does light charge as as sunlight does? Artificial light? Has to be solar. Mm. Artificial light, no. That's going to I know, different parts of the world too, if we're if we're marketing internationally. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Could I just ask referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with um standard batteries? I mean, could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible? Mm. So that affects the exterior design. Mm. Again it de Mm. It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature, i it's not gonna add anything, okay. Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally right, okay. It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research, it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field yeah. But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. Mm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it. I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over, that would give the spongy feel, that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone. Like a rubber sleeve almost, yeah. Mm. Mm. Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I don't s sorry to interrupt, I don't see why the curved thing is a problem, if we for example had a shell, once we open that yeah, so it'd be f yeah, yeah. Have I misunderstood you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the R_S_I_. Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to. Mm. Yeah. They're easy to replace as well, cheap. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? A pencil or a pen, so they wouldn't really need a Mm-hmm. I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me, it kind of applies to both our designers here, so I'm not sure how it would fit in. If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display, you seen those? And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing. They don't look at themselves? Just a thought. Yeah. I know what you mean, it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think, okay. trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side. 'Kay. Mm. Oh I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah. Sorry what does that stand for? Okay. No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Kinetic? Mm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, we talked about kinetic charging, we've deci seem to have decided on that, did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? No, one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they? I oh I see. Right, okay, got you. Got you on that okay, didn't realise. Sorry could you repeat that last part? L_C_D_ screen. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, okay. and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy, apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, just go for the colours. Okay. Mm-hmm. The feel. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size, made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted, market research, is that fancy? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else, but I mean I totally agree. We looked at those remotes, I mean they are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things. This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce, that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on, which is another beauty of it. Mm, so can I just recap uh Sarah, for the decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch-type batteries, um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, the case itself is plastic. That's how far we've got, what else do we have to add to our decisions here? Mm. Yes, it was just, there was just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost, is that right? And incorporating the company logo? Mm. 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they? Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper, I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location, have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then? You got to go through.
@highlight
Right um this is our conceptual design meeting , I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
@highlight
the minutes from the last time .
@highlight
Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
@highlight
we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal .
@highlight
We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
@highlight
Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .
@highlight
Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
@highlight
They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
@highlight
Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
@highlight
um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
@highlight
There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
@highlight
'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available .
@highlight
This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .
@highlight
There's um actually no rechargeable option available , I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , So you wind up your remote control before you use it .
@highlight
like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_ .
@highlight
I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .
@highlight
But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .
@highlight
The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , it like it runs for long time ?
@highlight
well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .
@highlight
referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?
@highlight
Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .
@highlight
Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .
@highlight
'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .
@highlight
most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical .
@highlight
Titanium um very expensive just to process , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .
@highlight
yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .
@highlight
I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .
@highlight
but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .
@highlight
I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
@highlight
Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
@highlight
but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing .
@highlight
We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
@highlight
you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .
@highlight
the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here .
@highlight
So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
@highlight
And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here .
@highlight
basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
@highlight
Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?
@highlight
So the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
@highlight
Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .
@highlight
We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .
@highlight
so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed .
@highlight
Do we agree on the battery ?
@highlight
The kinetic .
@highlight
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .
@highlight
Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , The L_C_D_'s not cheap .
@highlight
Maybe we could start with the black and white .
@highlight
did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?
@highlight
the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
@highlight
The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?
@highlight
Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , Um , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
@highlight
For the body design I think plastic , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
@highlight
And incorporating the company logo ?
@highlight
'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product I think you just address that with um advertising .
@highlight
Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
@highlight
Yeah , depending on the expense of it .
@highlight
Right I'm going to wrap it up there .
@highlight
it says , closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

ES2006b.json,"Mm. You said uh targ target groups, what does that mean? Uh okay, 'kay. So are Okay. Alright. I can go first, yeah. Right. Um so f from the Right sure. Uh okay. So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design, functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other. So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role. Um the identification of the components, uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person. Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design, so it's a cyclical process. Okay, so these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email. Uh I just quickly jotted them down. Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other. Um okay, so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated, so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control. Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television. How however, our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television, in order to keep things simple. Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard. Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip, so I'll basic go over to the Okay. So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell, uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, which is then communicated to the remote site, which h has an infrared receiver. Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger, basically. Okay. Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design, so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs. Um yeah. Anything else? Yeah. Certainly, yeah. So so tha yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints, but um unfortunately I I do not have any data, so uh I just identified the functional components for that. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. I it'll take some time. Oh, there it is, yeah. It'll come up, it um uh no signal. Yeah yeah, it says something now, adjusting Okay. Oh, that's strange. Okay. And one more time. Mm. Sorry, cou could you go back for a second? Uh switching on off channel, uh volume, okay, that's great. So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. Um but um so so at this stage, uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that? Right. Yeah, and it'll make the costs yeah. Right. Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that. Uh i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. So yeah? Cool. try to press oh, okay, yep. Mm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Right. Mm. Mm. Mm. Some kind of a ring, some Right. Hmm. Okay, that's great, thanks. Mm. I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people. So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned, if we want to have something sleek and uh you know, good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know, people who are comparatively elderly. Um. Right. Right. Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them, so if you want to put in something stylish, then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people, yeah. Right, and Right. Mm. Right. But uh still, if if you can go back to that slide and uh, how popular was it? Oh, oh, okay. That's alright, if you can just look it up on your computer, wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five, uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them. So even they are seventy six percent, is that high amount? Alright. Yeah. So you're more likely to b Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular, right? So mm uh are are are Mm. Mm. Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features, but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it? Uh and uh Yeah. But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it, you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. O Right. Mm. Right. Yeah. Okay, so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah. Mm. W What uh Mm. What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say, I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five. Yeah, so if uh if something like that can be incorporated, some kind of Mm-hmm. Alright. Yeah, that's Right. Mm. Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm. Yeah. Mm. So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_, so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control, wherever it is, it'll beep, so we we can probably come to know where it is. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, yeah. Right. Okay. So where exactly is this i Ah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah in that one, right yeah. No. Right. I guess I'll find out. Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into? Con components, oh.
Cool. Do you wanna give me the little cable thing? Yeah. Cool. Ah, that's why it won't meet. Okay, cool. Yep, cool. Okay, functional requirements. Alright, yeah. It's working. Cool, okay. So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. Um so it was all about, you know, how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control, you know. What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control. Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens, so I should have taken that bit out, but anyway. Um okay, so. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different. Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense. Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know, a nice looking remote control. Um current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, as you'll see on the next slide. Um I dunno what zapping is, but Oh, right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Um okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons, so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control, they just make it look ugly. Okay? Cool. Um so this is my little graph thing. Mm k Okay, well, I can send it to all of you. What it is is um it's cones, 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting. Um but ooh where's it go? Back. Oh. Oh yes, cool. Okay, I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing. Um okay, so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others. Yeah, so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance, you know, so on a scale of one to ten, how important is that and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, although I don't understand how it couldn't be, um and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, 'cause they're just not needed, and they're not used. Okay. This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing. Okay, cool. So um okay, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. Uh that they get lost, that the uh you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury. I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know, watching T_V_, then that's the least of your problems, but you know, it's up there. Um that yeah. Okay, so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that, like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know, not straining your wrists watching T_V_. Yes. Okay, cool. Right, um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table, and I didn't have time to white it out again. Um okay, but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that that, you know, younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it. Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_, you know, tends to be people talking and um, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_. Um okay? Cool. Um okay, so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool. Um you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist. Um there's a there's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got all this stuff, and you're just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both. Um okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and um, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. Um and then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah, that's it, you know. I know, it's weird. My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything. So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_, you know, 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes, 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something. So okay? Cool. That's me. Cat's. Ca. Yeah, I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control, but I'm assuming, you know, yes. Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it? So, you know Yeah. Oh, I've unplugged it. Do you want me to Yeah. Seventy six point three percent. Yeah. Yeah, I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds, but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean, you know, if you're at university, you're paying your rent, but you don't have a mortgage, you don't have a life insurance policy, you don't normally have a car, yeah, so. You're still learning to drive actually, so that just costs more than a car, but yeah. Um so I mean like it is an age group to target, really, I think. No, I mean that's what, that's like fifteen Pounds? You know, I think Yeah, I d I don't know many people without a T_V_. We didn't have a T_V_ last year, and everyone thought we were off our heads, you know. Yeah, I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_. Yeah. I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really. You know, so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore, you know. Is not a massive difference, you know. No, do totally. You do have it in your mobile phone though, don't you? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them. I don't know. Yeah. S so y you'd maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean? So like when you say change, except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_, so maybe like, you know, remote. I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_? Although I only watch Charmed, so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine. I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls. Yeah, that would be another way to do it. Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean Sky advertise on every channel, don't they, you know, so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed, and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky. Yeah, yeah, and that would be really annoying. Yeah. Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though? Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah. Yeah, 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control. Yeah, definitely, yeah. Oh, so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there, hey? Okay. There you go. But is everyone's called functional requirements? Okay, so that's good. That's me done. Okay, cool.
All hooked up. Okay, so now we are here at the functional design meeting. Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the sh shared documents folder. I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not. Did anyone? No. Oh well. Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder. Um and it should be in there. Project documents, yeah. So I'll put it in there. Is it best if I send you an email maybe, to let you know it's there? Yep. I'll do that next time. Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one. Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. I just sent at the last minute, I'm sorry about that, but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing. Um and then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the remote control. And we've got forty minutes to do that in. So I would say yeah? As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to, yeah. So we need to yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself. So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first? You wanna go first? Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours. I assume we just pull it out? Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back, just so that I don't have to scribble everything down. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point? Br Okay. 'Cause that's something to consider, I guess, if we're if we're using more advanced technology, it might increase the price. Yeah. That's fine. Are there any more questions, or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end? Yeah, I think that will do. Okay, so do you want to Yes, shall shall we pull this up? I think that has to come out of there. Yeah. Yeah, I thought those last minute things, they're gonna hit you the worst. It ta takes a little Oh, and have you you need to then also press on yours, function F_ eight, so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight. Now it's coming, computer no signal. Maybe again? Okay, adjusting. There we go, there we go. Oh, if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes, one where it's only here, one where it's only there, and one where it's both. Okay, so one more time. Should yeah just wait for a moment, adjusting. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_, I could get back to them and see. It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one? Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one. Do you want to yeah. Oh, I'm getting hungry. You set? Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here. Hello. Is it plugged in prop it's working? Okay. Excellent. It's um switching between channels, sort of randomly going through. Mm. Ooh, that's a bit difficult to see. If you explain it to us it'll be fine. Yeah. I liked the, I liked the litt ooh come back. No. Okay. Mm-hmm, that's the next one along, yeah? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The remote control. Mm-hmm. That's alright. Mm. Keys and things like that, yeah. Whistle and it screams at you, yeah. Mm-hmm. That's you, excellent. Um. I'm just gonna tick yes. So, we've got about ten, fifteen minutes to discuss Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions. Yeah, but you don't have much money, generally. I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five, when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh it's on sorry, we unplugged it. Here, let me Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, they've got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things. Kids. Yeah. Yeah, and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price, that's not unaffordable, even for young people. Yeah. Yeah. But do they But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five, but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, louder, tha that should be relatively simple. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. Um, so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money, then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising. Yeah, I think we need both. Yeah. Mm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great. Yeah. Yeah. Watch Sky and yeah. Mm-hmm. But that's definitely a possibility. Yeah. So that you can yell at it, yeah. Yeah. Alright. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's but then if you're buying the remote separately, but y you could have something, but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something, some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack, so one part attaches to the T_V_. The l Well that's right, but it solves the problem of having different noises. Yeah. Okay, I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um. But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the buttons so it's easy to use, but only those key buttons, the major buttons and then one sort of menu one, and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um. What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which y you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work. Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it, so that you know. It should be on your desktop, so on the yeah. So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them. Yeah, and email them round. Yeah, that would be great. Oh yeah, put them in there. Yeah, then you don't have to email them. No, they're all called something slightly different. Technical requirements and something something, yeah. So, if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to. Um as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept. Yeah? Whatever that means. Yeah. You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept, on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm? Components, yeah. No, we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare, so that's fine, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary. Okay? Right on time. Okay, so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec?
No. Mm. Um um wi on on a what? Oh project project documents, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Oh okay, yeah. Yes, I think so. Yeah, the last minute, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay, yeah, afterwards, yeah, okay. Thanks. I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably. Yeah. Yeah, I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay, yeah. Thanks. Oh i Okay, I hope wait. Should it just There's just nothing. Oh right, right, right, um Okay. Nothin okay, something is coming up. No signal? Why? Oh. My my computer went blank now. Adjusting. But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now. This is the problem, but Um. Uh now it's okay. No? No. Oh okay. Okay, that's fine, that's good. Okay, let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up. Um 'kay, so the method I was um adopting at this point, it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment. Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls, uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used. And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities. And yeah, and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words. Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, so this quite straightforward. And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. Um um I als okay. 'Kay. Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design, like operating a V_C_R_, but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. Um then yeah, the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel, and then volume has to be there. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu. And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update. So at the for the time being that's uh that's all. If you have questions Yeah, and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever, so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things. Um well, I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use, I mean um what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly, not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno. I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, but if if you have other mm proposals um. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh am I going in the right direction? No. Wait. Okay, here it comes. Okay, here you are. Um that's very good, very interesting. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, you share a television or something that yeah. It was seventy something, yeah, yeah. Yeah this this is not unaffordable, but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full Yeah. Common, the students yeah, yeah. The s the stu yeah, and the remote control might not yeah, it might not even function with the old T_V_. Yeah, we're still yeah. Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah, but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target, because actually I mean they're all still re young people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. An Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but uh um Yeah, yeah sure, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons and um, yeah it's it's kind of safer, so we we need both, so the voice recognition would be just an extra, it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote. Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away, so it might not pick up the other things coming from there. Yeah, but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control, so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance. Okay. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, mm-hmm. The major ones, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Did you find it? It's just yeah, yeah. Oh so so we'll just put them i there, we we yeah, w we won't even okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh something conceptual, yeah. Hmm. Sorry, but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare, okay, yeah, that's good. Okay. Cool. Okay, see you.
@highlight
now we are here at the functional design meeting .
@highlight
Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .
@highlight
at the last minute , then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control You said uh targ target groups , As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ?
@highlight
Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .
@highlight
So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person .
@highlight
Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level these were the basic findings from today .
@highlight
The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email .
@highlight
as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other .
@highlight
also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex .
@highlight
And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television .
@highlight
also the management wants that um our design should be unique so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .
@highlight
there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface .
@highlight
Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control .
@highlight
The user interf interface communicates with the chip , if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything .
@highlight
There is a user interface here .
@highlight
So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .
@highlight
so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .
@highlight
i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible .
@highlight
This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time .
@highlight
And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions .
@highlight
Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?
@highlight
No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .
@highlight
'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .
@highlight
we definitely need to operate within our constraints , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .
@highlight
computer no signal .
@highlight
I don't see anything on my computer now .
@highlight
Okay , that's fine , that's good .
@highlight
So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .
@highlight
Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .
@highlight
And and also the volume is very important .
@highlight
Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .
@highlight
So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size .
@highlight
And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .
@highlight
But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu .
@highlight
the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update .
@highlight
but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see .
@highlight
and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .
@highlight
So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .
@highlight
so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that .
@highlight
Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ?
@highlight
A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno .
@highlight
I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them .
@highlight
So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .
@highlight
Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well .
@highlight
So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .
@highlight
What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
@highlight
Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control .
@highlight
Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , Um I dunno what zapping is , It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .
@highlight
But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on .
@highlight
Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly .
@highlight
Um so this is my little graph thing .
@highlight
what it shows is how much things are used relatively so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls .
@highlight
Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .
@highlight
you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software .
@highlight
So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ .
@highlight
so these are my personal preferences .
@highlight
So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .
@highlight
Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist .
@highlight
so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit .
@highlight
so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or Some kind of a ring , Whistle and it screams at you , yeah .
@highlight
So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , Um and then like a locator , So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people .
@highlight
So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly .
@highlight
I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions .
@highlight
I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was Seventy six point three percent .
@highlight
but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .
@highlight
and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .
@highlight
but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote .
@highlight
I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really .
@highlight
but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people .
@highlight
Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , tha that should be relatively simple .
@highlight
y you'd maybe need a code word .
@highlight
but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .
@highlight
but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check .
@highlight
w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control .

If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five .
@highlight
So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .
@highlight
It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .
@highlight
Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .
@highlight
So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is .
@highlight
But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um .
@highlight
What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .
@highlight
Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .
@highlight
You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , and you're watching trends to see how we go as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .
@highlight
w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

IS1001c.json,"Okay. So we are here for the concept design meeting. So, we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken. Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards. So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours. We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task, to have to be done before the next meeting. So, last time we decided to have a simple interface. We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button. Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple. We have also button for volume, and to switch on off the T_V_. We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find, and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features. So now uh we will have three presentations. So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer, the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay. And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert. So maybe we can start with uh industrial design. So this is the presentation. Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But is it a significant price on the whole remote control? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control. So will will will this with uh including all possible things, so buttons, wheel and the chip, be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce? Okay You received something Hmm. And could it be adapted? Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff? Okay. Yeah. Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news. Okay. You can easily find the button in the dark or so? It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think, no? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. But it can be uh battery consuming, no? To have the light always on? Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations. Yeah. And it is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also does it uh fit well in hand? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's only the central part. Yeah. With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. S Okay. Will be down or Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors. Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple. So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect. Okay. So we can move to the Is there any question? For designer of user interface? or we can move to the next part, maybe, and discuss afterwards? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This is good also for Yeah. I think it is good also f to have a spongy material, yeah. Yeah, because it's robust. Yeah uh sorry? No. Yeah. Before? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has. Has it? Yeah. I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative. So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept. Cool, fancy? We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable. Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh, things like that. Maybe yeah. Yeah, and it's ergonomic as well. A pear. Yeah. Maybe pear yeah or something like that. Yeah. We can discuss that uh. D D Is is there anything you want to add? I don't think so. I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good, fit well, or banana as you told. Something like that. But that's not in the trend.. The trend is spongy, and vegetable fruits. I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. So, I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy, it's innovative, even if the cost is a bit higher, and we also have to find a, so, a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have. What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with? Odi Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. I think it's a good idea, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then. Maybe we can keep the banana. And it will be very easy to find. Yeah. Yeah it's really uh really a good point. I think it So One second. So we have to take some decision on this aspect. So, uh so for sorry, for uh component, so we have to think about those aspects, sorry. Yeah. I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape. But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped, with a spongy cover. Okay odd shape with spongy cover. And standard battery okay, a chip imprint, there's no specific problem. So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical. Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable. Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left. Mm. I think you can turn it this way also. You can do both with both hands. I think it's okay. Well, you you will get used to it. And moreover, th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side, because you have light on buttons. Yeah. No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand, whether you are righty or lefty. I think for lefty it's okay. I can do this movement, and for righty as well. I think this doesn't change that much. Yeah? So, for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side. And and uh a wheel on the top. So the colour is yellow. I think it's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take, yeah. So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting. So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision. And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product. That is to say, uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users, but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay. It seems to be fancy, innovative, and easy to use. So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together. That would uh be better, I think. And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails, as usual. So do you need to add anything? You feel okay? You feel uh free to express what you want to say? You don't feel too constrained? You don't feel free to answer this? Okay, so See you.
Uh, I_D_ you want? Yeah. I only v have three slides, so. I just look at the mm um just this. On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is, as I s mentioned previously, you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control. So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip, which is uh very very standard, and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button. And um yeah we can change directly. In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control. The push button are usually extremely cheap, but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive. And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button. Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button. Yeah. Yeah I I th But I don't think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money. But Um that's all yeah. I haven't chec Mm-hmm. Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry, I haven't written my personal references. Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button, and if we could reduce that. We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button. Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah. Actually. As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light. Yeah. Again. I don't think that this is really expensive, but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control, when you want to turn off your device Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. To s Mm-hmm. I support an apple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Ah it's okay. I know that they do that for alarm clock also. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about um And for maybe look and feel, what about a a piece of ice, with blue L_E_D_ inside? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Banana I think, it's a nice idea. Because But You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that, but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control, and here you have a a push button to Yeah. And everybody knows what is a banana. Basically. If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh, yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery? And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use. Uh what do you mean by case? Yeah. Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case, doesn't matter. I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box, and that's it. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Spongy also. Oh no I think it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. This is uh like the Mm-hmm. Wheel on the top. Button, where do we want some buttons? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Abdul al-Hasred is my name. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition? No? Yeah. You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed. Says Yeah. It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions. But I guess it could be I guess it's possible. I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command. Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff, so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it. Okay. Mm-hmm. I have a question about that actually. Um, what is the purpose of the light? Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on, the light? But if you move it then you have it, you don't need to find it. You can see the buttons better, of course. Yeah. But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement. Yeah, but you need another sensor for that, right? Yeah no it's too expensive. Okay. Mm. Extra. Yeah, okay. Mm. Yeah, but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. So uh my one, it uh should be in the shared folder. So. It was last time I saw it. Okay. So, just move to the next slide. So basically want very simple, right? That's the major idea, as simple as possible. So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls. And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple. And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler. Um. So. Yeah. Well this these uh these remotes are quite big, so go to the next page, so. We have all these buttons as you can see, but most of them, we just need the ones in the middle. So, from the bottom or whatever is there, uh the uh the numbers and then the top, uh until the ten also, this middle part, and on the left one is exactly the same. So it's basically more or less how we would like it, with a big volume control, big channel control, and mute and power, yeah? These are the basic thing. So basically, w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two. Yeah, if you have, for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb. It could be on the right side, for example. Yeah. Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have. And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it, it can break, you ca you can do various things. Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way. So that they're separate a bit, yeah. Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons, but uh, it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either. Mm. Yeah, I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user. Alright, you won't yeah. Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with, like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that. Yeah. That you want to protect a bit. And I think it's uh it's reasonable. So, I don't think Yeah, this is just the the wheel. We could use the some wheels can be pushed down, could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want. Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case. Yeah, I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that. Mm-hmm. Well, wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing, it it would work, right? Yeah. You can throw it to the television. Hey that's a cool one. We could say that if you throw it, you have a sensor, and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off. When it d uh takes a shock. Yeah. How do we make it look cool is the question. Yeah. Well the obvious thing is a banana, I guess. The banana is also ergonomic. Is there any fruit that is spongy? Yeah. You can make it um It's not hard, the metal. Plastic. Mm. Yeah. Two of the button, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve, yeah, and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side. So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool, no? You can put also vibrator inside. Ah-ha. You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. Yeah. I hope the students of management die, but anyway. Now who are recording this meeting? The only th Yeah. Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure. But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move, right? So, it's going to be bend a lot. So if we try to push the buttons, it You think it's possible? Okay. Yeah. Well, usually hold 'Kay, we want it to be good also for the left-hand users, right? Uh Yeah but okay. Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides, one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb. Basically. Or you could use use this one, but I don't know if it's very comfortable, to use this one for the wheel. This for the wheel and then this for the buttons? Should have the two sides. So if the left, we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons. Yeah, the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around, the buttons are on the other side. So you cannot see them. Yeah. So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know, but uh if you hold with your left hand, and the wheel is here, and the buttons are here, then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side. Okay. Okay. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes master. No. Yeah. Yeah. No. Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay.
Okay, I can go? Can I? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um. So, the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel. And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative. And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use. So, are things we are we have uh speak about before. Yeah. And um so you you can go after. And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends, uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furnitures. So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that, or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy. Uh I don't know which material can be spongy, and if you Mm-hmm. Okay It's robust, yeah. Not good. An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that. You ca uh you can go uh before, before, yes. And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel, after is uh technological innovative, and after the easy to use. Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible. Innovative. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Oh, colour, yeah. Oh i i I thought about a a pear, for example. You know the pear, is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah. Or a fruit like that. I dunno. Yeah. But you don't have Yeah.

So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?
@highlight
We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .
@highlight
You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .

Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .
@highlight
Um , what is the purpose of the light ?
@highlight
You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
@highlight
As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .
@highlight
I don't think that this is really expensive , Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?
@highlight
To have the light always on ?
@highlight
Yeah , a little bit .

Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .
@highlight
Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .
@highlight
And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .
@highlight
So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .
@highlight
I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , Yeah , because it's robust .
@highlight
I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .
@highlight
that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
@highlight
Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .
@highlight
Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
Maybe pear yeah or something like that .
@highlight
And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , But that's not in the trend .
@highlight
.
@highlight
I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .
@highlight
I think we can keep the wheel Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .
@highlight
but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .
@highlight
So we will just use a a standard battery ?
@highlight
chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .
@highlight
I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .
@highlight
I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .","```

ES2003d.json,"Okay, it's a I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas. Okay. Now do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. Um for one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_. As it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick, though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh ju just a thought. You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round, so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other. But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand, the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design. Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down. Yeah. this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing. Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. As for the um as for the single curve, um well this edge and this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it's not absolutely necessary. Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this. Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder. So. Any further comments? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I mean the uh Yeah. Yeah. I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand. One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber, I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure. So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely. Mm. Lovely. Um. Okay. Yeah, that's still part of the design. Mm. Mm. And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple. Mm-hmm. I'd say number one. I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile, you can hear it, but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is. Bu Yeah. Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger. Mm. So that uh th Mm. Mm. yeah. Mm. Mm. I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control. Mm-hmm. Um yeah I mean one thing, I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation? This is what I'm wondering. Oh no, I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved. It's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation. Mm. Yeah, I mean and I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here, the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight. Um I mean yeah, on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves. The curve that's really needed is up here, to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand. Mm. Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about. But I thought it was just completely pointless. Yeah. Alright. B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could, you know, say hello to, and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay, well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose. Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room. Or grey. Yellow. Okay. Three. I think we can do three. Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference. It makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap, it stands out from the rest of the crap. Two buttons and a joystick. Totally. It doesn't get much fancier. Mm. Mm. I'd give it a three for this for that. Yeah. I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote, but you see it in a lot of other places. Mm-hmm. I'd give it a three. Mm-hmm. I'd s I I'd give it a six, to be honest. Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours. Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow. If I were buying one, I'd go for purple. Leopard print would be cool. That's kinda i it won't be when it's been budgeted. I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie. Um. Mm. I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually. Mm. Mm. Personally, I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control that you've already got, are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good? Mm-hmm. I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative, um for someone who's sort of technophobic, the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting. Um. Yeah, got notes and doodles. Well I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this. It's all p goes into their corpus. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves.. Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along, squish. Yeah. Mm. I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh in added expense. Such as it is. Actually I want th one thing I would say I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget um m would make to sales. And we could even you know, market two versions. Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber. Yes. Mm. And I can get my bus. Okay. Thank you.
Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks, because it's gonna be flat on one side, so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this, won't it? 'Cause it you can't get it curved. Uh because of costs. And it's plastic as well, so it won't be as comfortable on the hand. Yeah,. One. Yeah. What about what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote. Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually. Mm. Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker. Mm. That's too expensive isn't it? Yeah. Fashion. So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now. Oh, and joystick, yeah. So The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of the remote. But that's what makes it uh original though, isn't it? It can be s yeah, it can still be single curved, but You just. That's what we need for the joystick I think though. Costs four. Yeah. Are we going for a special colour at all? Well I was for a case. Or had you already incorporated that? Think it's ten minutes left. Special colour. Three. Are we going one on? I'd say we go two, 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved. Wouldn't it? With the articulators. With bells on it. No need for teletext. five? Six? Six,. Put a leopard print on it. Yeah we gotta. I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that, that's that'd stand out. Logo, brand. Mm 'kay. Yellow courgette. Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto, like. And we're we're not doing well on it. Yeah, I'll go with five. 'S bad design, that thing. Mm, yeah. Well, it depends who your who's what the target people are, like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going, oh look at that, 's cool, it looks like a it's yellow, looks like a banana, it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room. Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good, it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick. So, which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it?. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Very good. We're burs bursting with creativity. And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost. And would it have to be twice that? It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro. We'll still settle for twenty five. Maybe. In the beginning, yeah.
. Right. Yeah I've got a if you load up my evaluation document. Mm. Uh evaluation. Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. Um then we will it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process. So um not seven steps, seven scale. So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype. And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those I put together from the user requirements phase. 'Kay. Um if you flip the So, those are the criteria. And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points. Put it mildly. So we have um true? One, t Seven, eight, oh. Fourth. Okay, so we have to go through each point. If we imagine it's actually straight, and just give it a a score. So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. I mean, uh is the homing thing still the locator, is that still Sure. And Adam, we can keep that in? Okay. Sure. T Sure. Mm. Bright colour. So we still have that noise thing, yeah? Os on a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? Number one? Okay. Number number one for the first criteria. Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You wanna say something? That's fine. Oh that's that's fine. What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna Um, a few. Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion. So they say we put the fashion in electronics, well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion, so. That's this bit right here. And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, so it's kinda condensed into one. And we can come back to it, you said. So. Different languages? Yeah. Mm. Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um?. Yeah, yeah. Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together? That's quite significantly expensive.. Yeah. We don't even have uh speakers here. The like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? Have we factored that in? Transmitter, receiver, speakers. Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_. Is that gonna be a button, or Yeah. I I mean it's not on here, but um. Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_? Okay. Well that's yeah. What's a hand dyna dynamo? You have to wind it up? Technology. Yeah. Okay. And we couldn't replace the joystick, right? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it, up down left and right, and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Uh k Does this does this bear in mind that I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it, like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components, you know. Mm. 'Kay. I think so. Yeah. Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface? 'Cause like we do we have re restrictions on software? Oh but there has to be joystick. Okay. Sure. Okay, my bad. So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria. Oh, wait a minute. Sample speaker? What is a sample speaker? Is that somewhat similar to what we want? Yeah. You got a email about voice response? I did not, so. We won't go with that one, did you say? I mean I we Okay, okay. So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing. Okay. Okay. Oh, special colour for the case. Mm-hmm. W what's the default colour? White or black? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay. Okay. So uh Right okay. Okay. 'Kay. Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Um. Okay. Special colour. Uh uh four. Three if we're being generous, I feel. Think we're being generous here with three. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Reduce the number of unused buttons. We're down to t two buttons, is it? Okay, so that's a one. You know, where that's Okay, that was good. Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus that's yeah that's good. 'Kay that's we're not doing so badly. Um easy to use oh okay, let's forget that one. Fancy looking. Sure. And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_. Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display. Maybe I was panicking for no reason. Yeah, w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah. There we go. Yeah, that's m that's that's better too. More accurate numbers. Technologically innovative. Well, we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, mobile phones. And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control, so it's You say three? I might go as far as two on that. Three. Three. Okay. Okay. Materials that people find pleasing. Sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. Yeah. That's true. It's not a step backwards. Yeah, okay let's give it a six. Okay, that's totally thrown everything off balance. Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. W we could. What colour were we gonna make it? I know, but But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg, Yeah. Mm. But Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing. Is this like a banana type colour? Could we stretch no still, it's not shaped like a banana is Oh is that 'cause it's flat? What is what fruit or veg is flat? Yeah. Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well. Four? Oh that's it's very ambitious, yeah, um. Sure. Inspired by. Yeah. This is their strategy. I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks. Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one. I would say I mean it's it's not at all, right? In any way or shape or form. We didn't m Okay, the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay. Right five. Is that sound reasonable? Five. Yeah. 'Kay, so we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. Which gives us an average of three. It's well this would be in the middle. So we it's it's not bad. It's in the good section. Oops. Sorry. I'm I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven, we were to go down a grade to to four, we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic. You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things, so I think we're definitely on the good bit. Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven, that's still only three extra points over seven. You know, it's yeah, we did it w it was okay. It was good. Mm-hmm. I think so. I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone, and she's had it for a long time, you know. She uses it to make phone calls and that's it. Yeah. So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick, I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy, you know. She'd be like is this a remote control, I don't how do you use it, and stuff like that. So even if it is really user friendly to us, but we're used to using menus all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons, yeah. But like radical good, maybe. Wrote nearly a page, but not. I think tracking. Yeah, that woulda been pretty good. I'd yeah I liked it, yeah. I li yeah, top marks. Well yeah. We we're not lacking in ideas, you know it's that was not the problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah, to begin with. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And like response from consumers. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's Thank you. I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff. It's like man, we we can't have the locator thing. And s yeah that's just bad. Do you think maybe the prices were were made?
That should hopefully do the trick, um. 'Kay. Sorry about the small delay. Falling a little bit behind schedule. And that's uh fifteen twenty five. Okay. So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it? Uh The new black, I believe. Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, though we should never avoid functionality, of course. Uh many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display. Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. Okay. So um due to your hard work, we might as well let the uh two designers go first, and uh show us the prototype. Quite how the best way to do this is, I'm not sure, but Okay. I'm afraid yeah. We'll go into that a bit more, but please go on. Mm. Okay, yeah. Great. Um. Yeah, okay. Excellent work. Um. Yeah, I believe so. So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost, 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element, but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have. Mm. Um just before we go through all of the steps here, um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright. Yeah, is that Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others? Okay. Okay. No and which we will do very very shortly. Um. Okay. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well. Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, require more buttons, etcetera. Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in, we've got point two of a Euro left over there. So we're just managing it really. Even then as well, um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now. Um. That should still be viable. We've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the L_C_D_. So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility. Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here. We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be. Um. We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person. Okay. It very much is about making concessions, unfortunately. Um. Um b b b da is you mean on the plastic, or? Let's have a look. You now have as much information as I do. Um. So as you can see here, for example, the battery really not very little choice in that one. We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to. I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost, which I've had to very much make advantage of, despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit. Problem comes here as you can see in the interface. Um if I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. That might make sense, because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what, four point five Euros, which is an awful lot, so that could well be wrong. Even if we save point five there, it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit, which has had to be put to one side. As you can see, the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick. I that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters. Um as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price. So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go, but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired, this one comes in under price as you can see, but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design. Uh no, we haven't, not That'll it literally would just be a button. We might have to It looks like almost nothing Mm. Oh good call, I missed that. that's a very valid point. So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display, then that's I believe so, yeah. That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such, yeah. Being manipulated by the joystick, yeah. Which I'm defining as scroll wheel. Um. Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be, that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation. If we remove the L_C_ display, we could save ourselves a fair amount. Which you could It's a shame. We should possibly have If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to. Again, you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one. Um but for the purposes of this meeting, I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures. So, I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us, despite the cost it's gonna incur. Um are people maybe not happy with, but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case, to keep the L_C_D_? It's hard to tell. Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation. Single curved with articulation? But the curves all o over hand, is it? We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway, so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation. Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal. Which is what we can get onto now. As long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well, but we're gonna say um single curved design It could well be, but at a cost of Okay, yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one. Yeah, that's voice recognition, so. Um. So, okay yeah, battery definitely, It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros, um. Maybe even slight well oh yeah, pretty much point two Euros, I'd say. So we'll leave that one for now. we'll just have It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure. One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right. So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more. Um. At which point if Well you got point five there. It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct. I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button. So There we go. Black's probably the normal colour you'd say, yeah. I quite like that colour that you're fetching there, it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better. So will we go with that then? It's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go. Just to give you an idea, um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well, I'm not sure how much time. We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet, but. Ten. Mm mm four? Three? Mm. Okay. Two buttons. Yeah. I'd say we're doing well there. Mm-hmm. As he models the I'd Yeah. Which is a shame. Mm. I'd be tempted with three, yeah. We'll get panned on the next one, anyway. Yeah, w It is, yeah. Don't blame them. Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such. Plastic, it sucks. But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have. Like yellow, yeah. It would also help keep the the product placement s yeah. Is it inspired by clothing fashion? Yes. It's kind o it probably Well I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg, so, what, four? Is that being too generous? Oh dear,. What would you think yourself? Well, it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. Si it's got a curve to it. Am I do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana? It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen. Um. Y oh and you've knocked batteries out. Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased, um it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly, based on um the the cost features. Maybe it's been targeted Hide it in the fruit basket. Probably the people technologically. They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um don't know how lo much longer we've got. At least five minutes I think. Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation. Um. So, we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction. Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them? For example um we'll work backwards I suppose. The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with. Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper? I would say I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. Mm. It must It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes. So maybe this is literally just a way around it. Um I dunno. How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? Leadership. As much as can be leadered in this uh thing. Um last one we've got is room for creativity. Now, I think we got Yeah I think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. Not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. It's a bit of a pity. Um I would have to agree on that. I think we needed a larger budget. If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector, then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is. Because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market. Mm. It could even That's true, yeah. Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess. As to a the costs involved. But I mean we've got a a prototype. So I dunno, I I think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and um such. Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end, I would have to agree. It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. Always hard to tell until you know the costs. Um. Okay. Are the costs within budget? Well, they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product. We've evaluated it, and we can say that we came out with a value of three. It's yeah? And then the final one where you get to call it Hal. But we'll go into that later. Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add, um anything they think that's not been covered, before I quickly write up a final report. Um I dunno, I mean we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be, but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers. There is a huge market. I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that. Yeah. So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add, we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such. Yeah? Uh thank you for your participation. That a question we can ask.

@highlight
do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design .
@highlight
Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ .
@highlight
As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design .
@highlight
this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .
@highlight
Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well .

As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , Really the curve that's most needed is the underside Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder .
@highlight
Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .
@highlight
if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure .
@highlight
So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by .
@highlight
it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process .
@highlight
seven scale .
@highlight
after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase .
@highlight
those are the criteria .
@highlight
And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points .
@highlight
we have to go through each point .
@highlight
and just give it a a score .
@highlight
uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost .
@highlight
I mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still Yeah , that's still part of the design .
@highlight
I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , Mm .
@highlight
And making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing , on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ?
@highlight
I'd say number one .
@highlight
just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ?
@highlight
is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion .
@highlight
Something I neglected from my initial research That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .
@highlight
And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ?
@highlight
I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , And we can come back to it , you said .
@highlight
Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do .
@highlight
Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure .
@highlight
Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs we've got point two of a Euro left over there .
@highlight
Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate .
@highlight
It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ .
@highlight
I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place .
@highlight
Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ?
@highlight
I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?
@highlight
You now have as much information as I do .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
I've said single curved .
@highlight
We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .
@highlight
Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button .
@highlight
As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .
@highlight
I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .
@highlight
uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ?
@highlight
Have we factored that in ?
@highlight
Uh no , we haven't , not Transmitter , receiver , speakers .
@highlight
Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ .
@highlight
That's too expensive Mm .
@highlight
I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .
@highlight
Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures .
@highlight
I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation ?
@highlight
Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , it can still be single curved , Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ?
@highlight
so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .
@highlight
Sample speaker ?
@highlight
What is a sample speaker ?
@highlight
that's that voice response thing that we got the email about .
@highlight
But I thought it was just completely pointless .
@highlight
B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice .
@highlight
it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing .
@highlight
One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right .
@highlight
l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , Yellow .
@highlight
make it glow in the dark even better .
@highlight
we'll come back to uh your evaluation Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost .
@highlight
Three .
@highlight
I think we can do three .
@highlight
Reduce the number of unused buttons .
@highlight
I'd say we're doing well there .
@highlight
Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus we're not doing so badly .
@highlight
Um easy to use let's forget that one .
@highlight
Fancy looking .
@highlight
It doesn't get much fancier .
@highlight
Technologically innovative .
@highlight
we're getting rid of the locator thing Mm .
@highlight
I'd give it a three for this for that .
@highlight
I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , Materials that people find pleasing .
@highlight
Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently .
@highlight
Plastic , it sucks .
@highlight
Mm-hmm .
@highlight
I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest .
@highlight
that's totally thrown everything off balance .
@highlight
Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion .
@highlight
I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours .
@highlight
Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype Leopard print would be cool .
@highlight
But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , It would also help keep the the product placement Is this like a banana type colour ?
@highlight
it's not shaped like a banana is I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , Mm .
@highlight
I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion .
@highlight
Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions .
@highlight
and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like .
@highlight
Yeah , I'll go with five .
@highlight
we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
@highlight
So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one .
@highlight
Which gives us an average of three .
@highlight
it's it's not bad .
@highlight
considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?
@highlight
which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?
@highlight
Probably the people technologically .
@highlight
I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction .
@highlight
Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ?
@highlight
Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper ?
@highlight
I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .
@highlight
I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this .
@highlight
Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves .
@highlight
How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ?
@highlight
Good .
@highlight
yeah I liked it , Leadership .
@highlight
As much as can be leadered in this uh thing .
@highlight
Very good .
@highlight
Um last one we've got is room for creativity .
@highlight
Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , We're burs bursting with creativity .
@highlight
We we're not lacking in ideas , Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing .
@highlight
I think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly .
@highlight
I think we needed a larger budget .
@highlight
Mm .
@highlight
I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such .
@highlight
Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah , to begin with .
@highlight
It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive .
@highlight
I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget um m would make to sales .
@highlight
is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um before I quickly write up a final report .
@highlight
we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell .
@highlight
but we've got something unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such .
@highlight
I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**

IS1004a.json,"Okay. Good morning everybody. Oh, everybody is not ready. Alright. Okay, let's go. So, we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes. Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager. Um you are the Okay. Okay, very good. Thanks for being here. Um so let's have a look to the the agenda. So, we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here. Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it. So, the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control. Um it should be original, trendy, and also user friendly. As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company. It is in three step as you know. First the functional design. The second's a conceptual design, and then the detailed design. During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately, individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next. So first, we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings. So who want to start? Mister. You have one in mind? Okay. Th thank you. Very interesting. Guillermo you want to? It would be very funny for us. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Hemant. Poor elephant. Yes. We have to I have to catch you, sorry. We have to to go through the meeting. Thank you. Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants. So so another important part of the project is about money, uh and about so about finances. So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros, okay. And we should target the inter an international market. O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly, so let's go to it. So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go. Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device? Should it be a universal one? And uh etcetera. So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go. Okay. Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah. So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go. So we need to close the meeting. Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do. So um you have to work on the on the working design, you have to uh work on the technical functions, and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs, alright? Um you will receive some information by emails, i as usual. Thanks for coming today. Thanks.
Uh almost. Ready. I'm uh Michael. I'm the user interface designer. Ah well if no one else wants to, yeah. Okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal. Let's see. Well, I don't really have a favourite animal, but um uh I think I have one in mind, so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board. The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs, and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions. Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes. There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web. And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else. So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away. So, that's my animal. Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone. So you don't like pink panthers? So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant, 'cause you haven't drawn the ears? Okay. We can discuss that off-line. So could I just ask one question, um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something? Okay, alright. Okay well, so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet, but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so, I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know, what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control, so it's Yeah. Okay. Alright.
Good morning. And I am Hemant, the industrial designer. But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther? So bad I don't like it. Um sure. Oh yeah. Thanks. This lapel is coming out once in a while. It's not very strong. Okay. So, not the favourite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant. I'll try to draw elephant. It's a problem. Okay, thanks. Okay so, elephant goes like this, and then it has four feet. I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest. And then we have it's trunk. And yep something like this. An eye, cute. Yeah, so and sometimes they have a hump. It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking. So when they walk, wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be. When they'll come to that position the second, the third feet will be there. That's the way they walk. And that's very peculiar about them. None of the other animals walk like this. And they are very useful to human beings. At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something, or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful. And they are found in um usually the warm countries. And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal. That's what I know about them. So, that's what I wanted to tell about elephants. There are two kind of uh yeah, they are very different, Indian and African elephants. So Indian elephant is having one bump, I think, and the African have two. And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals, these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there? Wind up? Okay, some other time. Thank you. Thanks. Marketing person. Mm-hmm. Thanks.
Hi I'm Guillermo. I'm the Marketing Expert. 'kay I dunno why, but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther, or maybe yes. Uh yeah yeah. Okay it's a friendly panther. Yeah maybe. Um. Actually, honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour, I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh, I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt, so but I like it because it's fast, and it's black as well, so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful, strong, uh I dunno. I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot. Okay. I like it. Yeah.

IS1008c.json,"Wow, good expression. Well after us. Actually, I'm ready to sell it. I'm ready to sell it. No y no no no, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, but there are some very pretty woods out there. That's actually very innovative idea. Well, it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood. I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised, individualised speech recognition remote control in wood, that's not on the market. In turns of wow. Wood? They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic, so, and chew 'em up. And chew 'em up. No. Hmm. Simple design. It's what consumers want. It's almost like, Houston, we have a product here. Problem is obviously gonna be cost. Okay, I also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. I also have uh copied a different type of remote. If you can find me, where I'm at. There should only be one in here. trend watch. It's being modified. They're stealing our product. We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today, 'cause uh trends change very very quickly. In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window, so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act. Uh they already erased the rest of mine, huh. No no, no no. 'Cause I had another comment there. Uh the market trend. This is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done, fancy and feel-good, that's what we've been looking for, something that feels good in the hand, that's easy to use. Looking for next generation of innovation, because all the remotes out there now, they're all very similar, they all do the same thing, we have to have something completely different. Okay? Easy to use, has always has become has become another major interest that uh, with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use. And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology. So even if we have a product that may be more expensive, if it comes out right, if they look it looks and feels good and has technology. The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy simple design. The second one, there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, uh very hard to use. The first one, I see that they put in a display. Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up, now we're adding all kinds of things in, but with the little flip-up, if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked. Maybe the display also makes it easier to use, because sometimes when you're looking for buttons, maybe if you see a display Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones, yeah. Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also. The idea is simple, but with a display, so you can see what you're doing. So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, uh with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours, we might've Mm-hmm. How hard they squeeze? Resistance resistance, right. No, but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market, totally different and from Although, what it was it uh it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours. Right, you take it apart, and put on another face, take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions, millions. So. So say with the f with the findings, with the research, easy to use something totally new. We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market. Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step. We're here to design, come up with a nice product. No. No no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it. Um, no that's no problem. I'm here for the pushing it after it's made. I will market it. Once we get a price on it then we can market it. Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case. And marketing strategy, thank you. Fired.
Okay. So uh, if you could open the PowerPoint presentation. I'm number two. Components design, there we go. So uh can we put it in slide show mode? Yeah. Right here, is that little that one, yes please. Thank you. I'll take the mouse. So uh we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components, uh the case, the power supply, uh the means of communications with the television set. In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition, you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device, but um maybe you do have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um, so it could be in the television set, could be in the device, but somewhere you have to put the microphone, um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost. Um so the other w thing that we So. Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record, what's worked, what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because, course, we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us, so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research. So um for the case, um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. Course, you know, I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable, but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore, so then we were thinking about um rubber, but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board. Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, so um we still had titanium and and wood available, but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh, the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium, although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood. So, this is our finding. And a as she said, it's an environmentally friendly uh material, so we're we're currently uh proposing, uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second. So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board, but uh these simple chips, but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one. And um then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one. Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print, and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender, which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip. And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print, so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should, you know, use some of uh some really exotic woods, like um, you know uh, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. I think that people will might really want to design their own cases, you see, they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet, and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that, and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip. So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood. Do you have any problems with that? I'm not sure, how do I Oh, I know, let's see. Let's go back up here. I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board. Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting. I don't know, but I'll find out more at our next meeting. Sounds good. Because um it gets brittle, cracks Um We want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. So. Good ex Good expression. I don't know, speak for yourself, I'm planning to be around for a while. you're what? You think? And you could you could sell oils with it, to take care of it. Well I'm glad you Okay, good. Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face. Mm-hmm. Mm. She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this. Luckily Ed was not. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it, they can use it for teething. Yeah, they do it with other materials as well, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Right, my hand is uh different size than yours for example. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. A hinge. Be like a copper hinge or you know. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure. No, f go to findings. Context-sensitive instructions, depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in. You know, maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball, and then they would squeeze it, and it would take the shape of their hand. To t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get. That's right, that's right, you wouldn't wanna go too far down that. Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect, yeah. Mm-hmm. Right, mm. We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna um learn about um labour laws. You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap, but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries. So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device. Cost of living is low. Good, well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more and to where Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you think Ed? Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed, um, do you know how much it costs, um, to to add a little display like this uh? Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Okay. Sorry about that. So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation, and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case. A customisable and Uh I don't think so, no, I think they could be rubber like they are now, so you have that tactile experience of So um are we done with this meeting? And a marketing strategy.
Mm-hmm. At least it's environmentally friendly. Thank you. Yeah. Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? Mm-hmm. Whic Which Although I think I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, wouldn't you, I mean it chips, it if you drop it, uh it's I'm not su I think if you re if you use really good quality wood, then it might work, but you can't just use Yeah, exactly, yeah. The stain. Um, in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own Y yeah. I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much, which you'll see with my presentation. One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh Yeah, for example. So, have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that, but Sure. One point three, yeah. Uh, yeah. I think so, yeah. Yeah, that's the one. So, it's a very short presentation, 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide, um, which basically shows, sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch, volume and channel control, the menu access button, ergonomic shape, which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded, so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls. And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea, is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size, so if someone has larger hands, you have a wider remote control. So, that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability. Um, one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around, they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off. And also um you had issues with the batteries running out, so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die. And in terms of invisible features, audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and, like you said, speech recognition. So, in terms of what this thing would actually look like Despite working in interface design, I'm not the greatest artist in the world, so you'll have to forgive me. You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself, so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons. And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for, oops, channels and volume, sort of for surfing channels and then volume, so the volume would be the up and down, 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right. And then here you'd have your sort of standard, telephonish number pad. And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control. So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice, they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you. Um, so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere, the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything? I don't think so. So, as you can see, it's a very very simple design, which is one of the things I really wanted to keep, is keep it simple, not have too many buttons, not have too many functionalities thrown into it. Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything, although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different. Yeah. But you also have to d start watching out for the weight, 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control, you don't want it to start getting too heavy. But that's the general layout with the general functionalities, if we come up with something else. As you can see, there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably, you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large, depending on personal preferences. So, that's pretty much all I had to say, I mean, everything else in terms of design issues. Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad, so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control, the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently. So once we decide exactly what we want, then we can figure out the exact positioning, but more or less I think it should go along those lines. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, no. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Yeah, so it's really molded to to your specific But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. The sales, yeah. Yeah. Well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. Yeah. Yeah. And that took off, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think it depends, I mean I think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you. So, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for, 'cause if it's only used for one little thing, then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever, may not be the most cost-efficient way to go, but that's just sort of speculation, I mean. Mm-hmm. What about the buttons, would Would the buttons be wood too, or Mm-hmm. Okay. Sure. No. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay.
Uh welcome back after lunch, I hope uh you had a good lunch together. For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting. Okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed. And finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes, I think it's uh little bit uh low, but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team, to the Christine, okay, to discuss about uh the components concept. You're number two. 'Kay The next one. Can you go back uh one slide? Yes, uh question, uh, what's mean exactly, advanced chip on print? What's the meaning of that? Mm-hmm. Yeah, is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh Okay, tha that would be great, so if you find out from the technology background, okay, so that would be good. So so you're not convinced about the the wood, yes. Yeah, so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh, what about yo you? Yes, in t yes, in term in terms of comments first Okay then, uh, let's move to Agnes. S you're You are in participant three. This one? So what's your, uh, the comments or uh s Okay Mm-hmm. Yeah. The Yeah. I hope so. Yeah. Yeah, but we can get a production in, uh, countries like, uh, India yes, yes, countries like India or China or Malaysia, so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more. So Yeah, yeah, so Yes. So Yeah, so Yes uh, but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later, okay, depends on the the quantity, okay. So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something, so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric, okay, for the different uh electronics items, then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost, okay, to sell more. So, but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept, okay, if is acceptable for both of you, what uh Ed was talking. And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so Yeah. Yes. I don't think so. Yes. Yes. Don't looks nice uh. Yeah, so uh what we'll do is, uh, we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra, in case we go for the display. Okay. So maybe what you can do is uh, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. Okay? Yeah, I hope, if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design, okay. Then they can show you how it looks like, and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management. Okay? Then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for uh the display. An and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay. Yes. How much you can how mu how much how much you can sell extra. Of course you'll make money too, so it it's not only pay-out, you make money too, your commission. Okay, so, any questions? So, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay, then uh, then we can proceed from there. It's okay? So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again, and see you soon then. Okay? Thank you.

@highlight
Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?
@highlight
Because um it gets brittle , cracks we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .
@highlight
I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .
@highlight
I the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .
@highlight
One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls .

@highlight
Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is I also have a f very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .
@highlight
I also have uh copied a different type of remote .
@highlight
We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly .
@highlight
Looking for next generation of innovation , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use .
@highlight
Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology .
@highlight
The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design .
@highlight
The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .
@highlight
The first one , I see that they put in a display .
@highlight
Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .
@highlight
Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .
@highlight
Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .

Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .
@highlight
it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours .
@highlight
Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions .
@highlight
We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws .
@highlight
You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries .
@highlight
So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .
@highlight
Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India We're here to design , come up with a nice product .
@highlight
but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay .
@highlight
So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .
@highlight
because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you .
@highlight
I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?
@highlight
Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?
@highlight
Once we get a price on it then we can market it .
@highlight
So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .
@highlight
A customisable and What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or I think they could be rubber like they are now , what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .
@highlight
maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .
@highlight
Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display .
@highlight
An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay .
@highlight
So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there .","```

ES2008b.json,"Good to see you all again. Let's see if that comes up. This is our functional design meeting. Um. Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up. Et voila. Okay. Mm um we put the fashion in electronics. Let's start. Okay, our agenda today um just check the time, it's twelve thirteen. Um. I'm gonna do an opening, talk about um did you all get the minutes? I e-mailed them to you. I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder. So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received, and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions. Finally we'll just close. We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes. So First of all the functional design objectives. Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled, the functions design, what effects the apparatus should have, and the working design, how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function. Okay, three presentations, um you can go in any order you choose um. Sure, please do. Yes I do. Yeah. Function, F_ eight, yeah. The blue one, F_N_. Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and Mm 'kay. It's taking it a little bit 'Kay there you go. Press the little presentation. It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw. There, that one, there you go. Thank you very much. That was that was great. Um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects. Was that you? Great. Push. User interface, right. Interface. Mm 'kay, thank you. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm 'kay. Thank you very much. That was very useful. It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes. Um. And neither of them were very pretty, you know? Mm. Mm. You there it is. Lovely. Hmm. Um the it's right above Draw. There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom. Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk. Yeah, that one. There are Y_s. You just press yeah, just click. That'll be fine. Um yeah use that thing you can go back, previous. Pardon. Oh, well. Okay. Ye Double click on it. With the right with the left hand one. There we are. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excellent. So, um. Yes, absolutely. Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things. Lefty loosey, righty tighty, right? Lefty loosey, righty tighty. Oh yes. Mm 'kay. Um I have nothing on my screen. Just a sec. Here we are. Okay, yeah, it's fine. Okay, requirements. We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this. We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet, so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that. Um. It no. W d could would you care to explain it? How? Okay. Interesting. Okay um, well, we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that. Um Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television, video, or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on. Um otherwise becomes to complex, we wanna get this out um very quickly. We only have a a short amount of time. Um and finally there's more marketing, I think, um, our corporate image has to be recognisable. So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design. Looks like, yeah, kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um mm-hmm. But it's, yeah, we put the um fashion in electronics. So we gotta keep that in that in mind. Yep. Yep. Yeah, or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow. Like, we can we can play around with it a little bit. Um. Okay, we need to talk about our functions and our target group. We need to decide who our target group is. You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences, for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition, but younger people did. Um and so who are we aiming this at? Mm-hmm. It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember, so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is. Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself, so it will probably be sold separately, twenty five Euro by itself. Now, those are that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we gonna use that as one of our functions? Mm-hmm. Mm. To produce it, yes. Mm. That's a good thing to keep in mind. Upgrade? Well, we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly. Simplification, so Uh-huh, mm. And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or Kind of pull out of the side. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information, but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing. Um. Okay um, so what are we emphasising? I what in this project? Simplicity and fashion. Okay, those are very good goals, I think, um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do. Simplicity and fashion and, yeah, or usability speci however you wanna say that, which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional, so that you don't have to travel around a lot. Um. I think it's a lot to do with battery, but that's just my Mm-hmm. So our target group, we're saying, fifteen to thirty five? S voice recognition, which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control, like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c, you know. Seems a little bit Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it might be too expensive. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Under sixty five, okay, that's a good start. Um. I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty? Okay, single It's it's hard to narrow it down. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because, yeah, things so different will appeal to different people, but Okay. Um oh, there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something, I don't know like or beep? Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay, we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions. So let's do that quickly. Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost. And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things. Large, accessible buttons for the essentials. We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions. Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, hidden way. And we also want it to be fashionable, which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah Mm-hmm. Okay, do it. Any other essential functions that we need? Battery? Do we need a long-life battery? But we might as well. Yeah, I would imagine. Just 'cause it is an electronic device, the Charging. Mm-hmm. We have to think about um space in living-rooms, too, like 'cause they're I mean, would you put it on top of the T_V_? I don't know, just think okay, that's that's a good idea, we'll keep it. Think it's And maybe fun. Okay. Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now, has everyone said their functions and 'kay. Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary. I don't know what summarisation. Um and then we'll have our lunch break. After that we have thirty minutes of individual work. Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides. If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great. Um you each have individual actions, I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept, User Interface, the user interface concept, market trend wa watching. And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you. And hopefully, I hope, next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could. It's kinda frustrating, but um Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary. Mm 'kay? Great seeing y'all. Looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do, it's from like an earlier project, I think so um Under the shared folder, I don't know it might not even be under yours as well. Projects. Okay. You don't have mine? S Mm. Okay. Well I'll figure that out in the meantime. Okay.
Yep. Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there Ah that's it, yep. And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop. That's it. Repetitive strain injury. Repetitive strain injury. So if you Cheers. Here we go. Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um. We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television, so i it's basically a communication device. We we tell the remote control what we want to do, it sends a message to the television saying change the channel, change the volume, uh yeah, adjust these settings, adjust the brightness. Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. We need to know what our final product is gonna be like, so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does, uh how it works, and what the end-user is gonna want from this product. Um. Oh, a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product, um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work, uh sorta find out what people think of 'em. Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience. Um, and different different people sort of prefer different things. Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment. When a users using a remote control, he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people. But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different, something that stands out. Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is. The second is is economic, uh we need to find a balance between features and price. So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product. So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls. In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them, uh what things do they get right, what's bad about them, what's wrong with 'em, um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls. Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control, so it's one that's got lots of buttons, it's it's fully featured, everything you might possibly want to do is there, you know, it's got forward, backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, uh freeze frame. Yeah, it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it, but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_. The one on the right is a lot more basic. It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel, play, stop, volume. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it, but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts. There are disadvantages, you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture. Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two. Um as I said before, remote controls are subjective, different people want want different things. Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple, it it's easy to use, uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel. It it does everything that I need it to uh, as I said before, I'm quite lazy, I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television. I also want something that that looks cool, um and that that feels good, that's ergonomically designed. I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool. And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress. Uh that was just on the d on the company web site, yeah. What's up? Lefty loosey. Uh. Never heard that before, that's good. I'll think of that every time now. You don't have it in the States? Oh, I didn't realise. Um yeah, it's like a I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser. Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control, uh y and you type in the page number you want, so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it. And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information, mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing. Yep, news headlines. It's earl it's pretty old technology. It's like nineteen eighties. Right. So what's our corporate image like? It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics. It's like double R_. Yeah. Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it. Right. Right, okay. Yeah. Um. I I would say no, because it's gonna add too much to the price. Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product, people are gonna be paying uh, well, uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it? And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The remote There are remote controls like that, yeah. Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons. So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it, then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a good idea, yeah. Yeah. Si simplicity and fashion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, yeah, it's pretty it's pretty high-tech. It's for, like, the ultimately lazy people, who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote. Yep. I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages. I mean, we we said simplicity is is one of the features, so it's going to appeal to people, maybe people who have problems with technology, you know, people who get scared by having lots of buttons, and that might be older people, but then we've also got fashion, which is something that definitely appeals to younger people. Yeah. Yeah aim for a an income group. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features. We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all. I suspect the remote control does need a battery, but I dunno if you can Yeah. Yeah, without the energy, yeah. Yeah, that's that's possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.
Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it? I dunno. How do I hook my screen up? Where does it go? Mm-hmm. Hmm, I'm not supposed to move this, but Where's function? No signal. Ah, wait, 's screw in. Push the screw. Mm alright I've never attached to anything. Alright, so, I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is. But, I don't even know how to play this. No. Alright. So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research. They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs. Focusing on their desires, um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly, seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though, eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. I don't know anything beyond what fancy means, but that's particularly of use to us, I think. Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age, so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions. Um people also had certain frustrations, that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design. That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes. I think, over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons, it just needs to be easy to use. It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is, because I don't know. What? Ah. There we go. Wow. People do not like that. So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing, people do not like that, um the repetitive use, I guess, caused a strain. Um looking at the needs people specified, the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour. People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume. People also zap like to change the channel, about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use. So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings and the channel settings, because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on. So I think that some things that we might wanna think about, the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were, so I dunno know if that's coming to me later, or something like that. But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use, make sure that, you know, something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often. And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like, that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it, so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that. Hmm. Yeah, have I unscrewed it? Here we go. Mm-hmm. And I think that's in the shared, if I did it right, if anyone wants to look at it. No. A fashion fashion remote. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So wait, did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see? Okay. 'Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google. Yeah, that's a good one it'll stick with you. What's teletext? Oh. Oh, so Mm-hmm. Oh. That explains a lot. That's good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one? The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump, after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice, so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range. But what else are we gonna put, I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it, I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though. So like other than just making it look good, how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote? Mm-hmm. If someone's looking to buy a new remote, don't they want like an upgrade? I dunno. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can you like I mean this may be too complicated, but, I wish I had something to explain it, like if it was just a simple, either this way or this way, that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out, kind of and like you got the rest the buttons, but the rest of them like went in. Do you know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm. 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them, never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out. And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes, one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones, but 's all still in one. Yeah. I think simplicity, fashion. Mm-hmm. What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional, like why would it not be? I'm just wondering. Okay. So 's just the quality of the chip. Okay. Well, I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing Yeah. Yeah. I don't. And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice, like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_. Mm yeah. Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers, I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages. But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also, which isn't, I mean, really isn't that representative, especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group, so Twenty to like fifty five. I dunno. Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age, maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that, like, well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television, and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing. Yeah. H I mean, like I said before, fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it. And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in. It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think, so Hmm. on your coffee table, it's not like an eye sore, that kind of thing. Yeah. So you never have to change the battery. Mm. It's good. Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder? Okay. Yep. Where is that? Yours is I only have three, I just have like our three. Yeah. No, but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate, like it's not on the server. But if I open it and then save it, probably will be there. Oh wait, never mind you can't save it to the Okay.
Right. I think, you might have to disconnect Rose. Yeah. I I think you just have to push it in really hard. Oh, got it. Mm, neither have I. Alright. Hmm. 'Kay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm 'kay. Okay, great. Hmm. Yeah. I think that could be our selling point. Right. Hmm. Right, I really can't see what I'm doing, so does anyone have a Ah-ha, look at that, showing up already. Yeah. Alright um No, how do I play again? Ah. Okay. So this is our working design presentation. Um I had a bit of some issues with this, because I wasn't able to find everything I needed, but I guess that's we're still in early stages. Um so, yeah, this is this. Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function. Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out, and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work. Don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but how do I get to the next s ah. So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function, what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done. So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen. So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function. And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately. So um Uh. Uh. So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line. So that's one thing we're gonna work on. Um the user interface is critical here, because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data, which then goes through the infra-red, so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing, is gonna be crucial. And really it all comes down to the to the user, because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design. So the components that we find here are the energy source, you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work, then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver. So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip, which is also controlled by the users. You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh. Previous. Sorry about that, guys. Oh. No, no, no, no, no. Okay, let's just get back to my schematic here. W yeah, yeah. I think it's frozen. Here. Don't show me that tip again. There we are. Sorry about this, guys. I'm kind of pathetic with things like this. Um alright. So you have your energy source, your user interface who's controlling the chip, the chip also uses the energy, and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb, which will then bring the data to the receiver. So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way. This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out. And personal preferences, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long-lasting energy source, people don't wanna be changing it a lot. We need a chip that works well with the user interface, that isn't too complicated. We need a straightforward interface, like Ian was saying, simple, not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal, so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands. So that's pretty much it for the working design. Rose, do you think you can give me a hand with this? Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna stick in your head. Mm. Ooh, no signal. Okay. Uh, it's a British thing. No. S Lottery numbers and sport scores. But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now, that's what they're talking about. I have no idea why we don't have it, but 'Kay. Mm. Okay, so we want something that looks good and is yellow. Okay. Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, so that might be a fairly good target group for us. Mm. To produce it, yeah. Hmm. But right. Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology, in fact it could use it could mean, not. If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology. Yeah, simplification. They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use, or maybe it broke, or maybe they're just missing it. Hmm. Ooh. Ooh. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's a good idea. Mm. Good point. Yeah. Yeah mm. The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well, without sort of scattering. Yeah. I think so. The quality uh quality of all the components really, I mean, we can't really do anything shoddy work, 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line. Mm-mm. Yeah. Ooh. Yeah. I Mm-hmm. Yeah, but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something. Or like single professionals or something. Yeah. It's really hard to figure out right now. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, t probably. Mm. Mm. Yeah, that'll probably be good. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. Battery battery use. Yeah, but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. It I think it does. I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one. But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod. You could we could maybe do that instead. So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery. I dunno, that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place. Mm. Yeah. That's just off the top of my head. Yeah, who knows. Okay Sounds good. Yes, I just did that. Hopefully it is there for people. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Technical. So in there we have technical functions presentation, working design presentation and the functional requirements. At least that's what I have in. Yeah, that's what I have as well, R Rose So. Yeah. Okay.
@highlight
This is our functional design meeting .
@highlight
our agenda today um Um .
@highlight
I'm gonna do an opening , did you all get the minutes ?
@highlight
I e-mailed them to you .
@highlight
I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder .
@highlight
So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations .
@highlight
Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions .
@highlight
Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .
@highlight
I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is .
@highlight
How do I hook my screen up ?
@highlight
there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there And then you have to press function F_ eight I I think you just have to push it in really hard .
@highlight
we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .
@highlight
They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .
@highlight
Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote .
@highlight
and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes .
@highlight
I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration .
@highlight
People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , Repetitive strain injury .
@highlight
So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .
@highlight
People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .
@highlight
People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use .
@highlight
So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often .
@highlight
And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um .
@highlight
it sends a message to the television First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .
@highlight
so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .
@highlight
a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work , When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .
@highlight
So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .
@highlight
Uh the first of these is is technological uh we need to find a balance between features and price .
@highlight
things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .
@highlight
I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls .
@highlight
In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .
@highlight
Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , The one on the right is a lot more basic .
@highlight
It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control .
@highlight
everything you might possibly want to do is there , Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .
@highlight
that's ergonomically designed .
@highlight
I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .
@highlight
did it let you go on the Internet Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .
@highlight
and then I'm like wait it won't let me google .
@highlight
this is our working design presentation .
@highlight
Um I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .
@highlight
Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder .
@highlight
because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .
@highlight
So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .
@highlight
the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver .
@highlight
And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , We need a chip that works well with the user interface , and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , requirements .
@highlight
We have a couple new requirements but we're not gonna work with teletext We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , What's teletext ?
@highlight
Uh , it's a British thing .
@highlight
I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser .
@highlight
this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it .
@highlight
and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .
@highlight
It's earl it's pretty old technology .
@highlight
like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera .
@highlight
Just for television .
@highlight
That's what we're focused on .
@highlight
Um otherwise becomes to complex , Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable .
@highlight
while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .
@highlight
It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .
@highlight
and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black It's like double R_ .
@highlight
we need to talk about our functions and our target group .
@highlight
You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this .
@highlight
I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?
@highlight
at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea .
@highlight
that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , that's all specific for speech recognition .
@highlight
Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?
@highlight
I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price .
@highlight
And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .
@highlight
but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ?
@highlight
Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?
@highlight
or we can look at um user-friendly .
@highlight
And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them what are we emphasising ?
@highlight
I what in this project ?
@highlight
Si simplicity and fashion .
@highlight
which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , I think it's a lot to do with battery , So 's just the quality of the chip .
@highlight
So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?
@highlight
I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing S voice recognition , And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .
@highlight
but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .
@highlight
can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ?
@highlight
It's it's hard to narrow it down .
@highlight
I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages .
@highlight
so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ?
@highlight
Like a button on a T_V_ you can press It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .
@highlight
And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things .
@highlight
We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions .
@highlight
Which are kind of hidden away in some way Battery ?
@highlight
Do we need a long-life battery ?
@highlight
We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .
@highlight
But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .
@highlight
Yeah , that's that's possible .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .
@highlight
that's that's a good idea , Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary .
@highlight
After that we have thirty minutes of individual work .
@highlight
Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .
@highlight
If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .
@highlight
I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching .
@highlight
And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you .
@highlight
And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary .
@highlight
were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?
@highlight
Hopefully it is there for people .
@highlight
in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .","**Meeting Agenda: TV Remote Control Design Project Update**

So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so I make uh u user interface. You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it. Make make yeah. Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh, it's the function design. I design the user f user interface, you design the function. Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And uh simple. And easy to use. Ah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah, you try. Try first. You can draw something which is very simple. Oh, maybe we should bring Kemy here. Kemy is really good at drawing. You're going to draw? Okay. What's this? It's a fat cat. Can you draw uh um rabbit? Oh, hat ha rat. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. Mm. Okay. Oh. Okay, I draw. The only thing I can draw is like this. Oh. Oh. Oh. No. What's this? Okay. Okay. The only thing I can draw, because it's very simple. Oh. Okay, be careful. No problem, no problem.. A person? Dog. Okay. Okay. So we have break. Oh. Hmm. No. Okay.
Yeah. Mm-hmm. So right now? Mm. It's reasonable, I think, yeah. Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI and okay. Okay. Okay, and Marketing Expert, it's me. You can manage all this, yeah. Good. Um. Not really. So which you, the Industrial Designer. Okay. Yeah. I mean, you have to know. Ah, you have to know it. It's your job, so I hope you you know what it is. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Well. You know. Oh, okay, okay. Not the other one. Yeah, I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer. Mm. Mm-hmm. And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty, so. That's the problem. Mm. It's clear. Yeah, maybe should go and draw an animal. Many Yeah. Uh it's the same as mine. It's the fat cat, okay. A rat? That's difficult. Yeah. Just go, you you the closest to the whiteboard. Jus Yeah. A duck. Pikachu. Oh yeah. Bugs Bunny one. Okay. I go. What? Oh. So what else? This was my favourite one, but Right. A fish. Oh yeah, doesn't look so fine. Okay, it's your turn. Mm. Good. I think it's done. Yeah. Oh, we have twenty five minutes for the meeting. Okay. Know what time is it? No. Good.
Ah okay. It's Ada Longmund? Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard, yeah? Yeah, I don't know. I it's it's reasonable, s quite yeah. Twenty five. Is Yeah. I I hope so I_D_ is for the Industrial Design, yeah? And U_I_D_, it's for the User Interface Designer, yeah? AMI yeah project. you will be the manager yeah. I am the Industrial Design, yeah I am the Industrial Designer so. It's difficult. You know very soon. So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Yeah. So the materi Okay right. But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know. But I don't know. Okay. I'm the industrial designer. So. Okay. So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay. It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, I don't know. Is it? Are we supposed to do right now? Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now. Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it, so. It's not matter So. yeah. It's a It's a cat. It is not a fat cat. Yeah, it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat. It's your rat. Okay, go right, but in grow, it's everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea, so It's a rabbit. It's not so bad so. So you don't have a A fish. That's a that's a fish? Okay, let's try to draw something. Have to be really careful. Ah it's my turn. Okay. So. It's ok So, what can I draw some more?? No. Mm Yeah, it's it's a se it's my priority this one. Yeah. No. It's a really crazy dog Okay. Transfer. It's a dog in a village. So what are you sug going to do now? It's done? Oh my God. Yeah, it's okay. We have an idea yeah. I have an idea of my job so yeah so. Yeah.
So we can start? Suppose I have to do my presentation. Eh um So, I'll present myself, I'm Ada Longmund, and as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager. So um we will have to um speak about m the project. Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control, so the remote control has to be original, trendy and um user-friendly. Record. So the project method is the following. So if we're um the functional design, you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other. Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design. Uh. The tool training is to try out the white board, so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later. So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's quite good price, yeah. And uh it will uh be a an international remote control, as we want to sell it in the entire world, and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. So, as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control. Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls, try to create something new and people would like to to buy. And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do. And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. Yeah. I_D_, yeah. So So I will manage all all the group. So you have questions? So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do. Mm-hmm. And you? Mm okay. Hmm. I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. And i maybe you will transform it. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. And yeah. And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product. So you don't have to do something really specific, as everybody everybody will have to use it, it's sor the same as keyboards. You know, you have Qwerty, Azerty, French and U_K_ keyboard, so really the remote control to be international. And not too expensive. As we want to maximise the benefit. Yeah, you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros. And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now. So, is it okay? So you think we have to do it now? You want me to draw something? Product manager okay, let's go, I will try. No. A mouse is not too difficult. Mouse is okay. You love the eyes. Yeah, that was the eyes. A clown. Rabbit. It's a rabbit. Yeah. Thank you. You forgot the chips. Fish and chips. Of Oh.? Oh yeah. Yeah, I think yeah. Just have to present project, discuss a little bit about it. Yeah. So, if you have questions. It's okay? You know your job? you know your job? You know your job? Okay.
@highlight
I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .

Our project project is to create um a new remote control so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .
@highlight
if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other .
@highlight
Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
@highlight
Uh .
@highlight
The tool training is to try out the white board , Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
@highlight
I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .
@highlight
the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros .
@highlight
it will uh be a an international remote control , I think it's quite good price , yeah .
@highlight
and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes .
@highlight
try to create something new And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
@highlight
Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think .
@highlight
AMI I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , I will manage all all the group .
@highlight
and Marketing Expert , it's me .
@highlight
what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design ?
@highlight
I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
@highlight
I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
@highlight
Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
@highlight
'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
@highlight
I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
@highlight
so really the remote control to be international .
@highlight
And not too expensive .
@highlight
And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
@highlight
There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , Are we supposed to do right now ?
@highlight
You can draw something which is very simple .
@highlight
It's a It's a cat .
@highlight
you have to draw a rat if you want a rat .
@highlight
It's a rabbit .
@highlight
Right .
@highlight
A fish .
@highlight
we have break .
@highlight
present project , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .

Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes, so you have to be very quick. And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal, okay, and I have to discuss a few points on this. Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project. Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded, okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology. So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. And the second one is about uh the remote control. Should be used only for the T_V_. That's what our uh management says. And the third point, it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image, okay, with this new project or new product. Okay. So I will invite uh Agnes, can you go to the third slide? Okay,. So, I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design. Yeah, let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility, other feature, like uh unbreakable. Okay, because uh especially today, you know, you have the family and the kids, okay, and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and. Yes. Okay, so if you can add the feature, okay, for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, okay, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, if I'm not wrong. Maybe you can uh add it in that. Okay, uh thank you Christine, and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications, or any discussion on the functional design? Yes. Yeah so Yeah the the I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing. Uh let me go quickly, maybe if I can go back. I know the project plan and the budget. So I can close this, not sure. Was in uh S This. So let me see where is this file. This is Christine. That's yours, okay. Saving. Okay, uh I will I will send you a mail, okay? The project may be the the project aim, okay. At the end of the day, the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro. Okay, and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side. Okay, that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market. Okay. Then uh you can come back with your feedback. And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion. This remote control, okay, it can be for like universal, to use for any T_V_. Okay, and it will be slim, okay, and uh Not fat. Okay. Yep. But let's try it, okay, with the different uh the designs, okay, the functional designs. Okay? So any other questions? Okay. Thank you Christine for uh time being, so then uh Ed, so can you tell about Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep. So what do you think about uh the design? Do you think you can make it or uh What do you think about uh the design, uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition? Mm-hmm. Yep. Well, what I can uh suggest to you, Christine, okay, uh if you need some uh the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about uh this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_, okay, because they're already in this uh speech recognition part, okay. And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them, some kind of a technical tie-up. Okay, and uh if you want, I can coordinate, okay, to get some information, okay, and uh you can uh let me know, okay, so what kind of uh the details you require okay, to add this feature in this project. I don't think it's uh the difficult. And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from uh what today. Yep. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. Yeah but but end of the day, you're the sales guy, so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection, okay. It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit, okay. And uh, so I don't mind to convince, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project, okay, if you can make out of the money from this project. Yes, okay I don't mind to convince the the management, okay. The management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, which it's already worked, okay, they want something uh new, okay. I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree, I don't think they'll say no for that, okay. And uh I hope I can convince the management on that, okay. So if you have any uh new ideas, okay, for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special, okay, coordination, okay, between any uh technical companies, which you can uh hide their technology backup, okay, for your uh functional design or technical design, okay, then I am ready to do that. And uh what's your comments about uh Yeah, so you are finish, Ed, uh so I can uh Okay, I'll uh hand over to Agnes. Just gonna close this. T Uh where are you, here? Participant three. Okay, so I'll yep. Okay. Is it okay? Alri Click mm. So for anybody need uh any help, for time being, on this uh subjects, okay, so please come back to me, and uh Christine, maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim, okay, and to add some features, like we are talking about, the speech recognition and all. Yeah. So not really this one we are talk ab Yep. Okay, that will be great. And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet Yeah. Okay, what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break, okay, then uh we can discuss furthermore, okay, with our areas, and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting. So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting, and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information. Okay? So let's go for lunch then. Thank you.
Fantastic. Titanium. Expensive. I don't know, I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell. Hmm. Uh from her side, I don't think uh there's too many more questions. If you can come to the Okay, from the marketing yeah, from the marketing side, just to to give an idea what the management is looking for, I was looking for a a remote control to have a s I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro, with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro. For what uh I think from what we're trying to find, we're tr we're looking for, I don't think that price is exactly in the market. Okay? I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a in the recent surveys, uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. Twenty-five Euros, uh that's that's a preson reasonable price. That's a market price right now. Now if we're gonna take a risk, and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, but give them added things that they don't have now, then it w it could possibly sell. Obviously the risk is there. Too expensive, they're not gonna buy. But, I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested. And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. Obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. I dunno, louder, softer, on, off. That might be a possibility, even though it costs more, to be the first on the market to produce this. Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly. Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. So maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep, and they can find it through, you know, ten tons of newspapers, magazines, whatever you have at home. But, in the cost that uh the management is looking for, that's not gonna be possible. But if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some colour to it, if it's very easy easy to use, if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on. So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea, with the ideas of the industrial uh design. But, price obviously we have to talk about. Speech recognition. Mm. Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea but th if it's a one-word recognition, 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States, a friend of mine says call Mom, and it calls up Mom. 'Kay the radio can be on and everything. Because I think s with speech recognition, if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear. I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television. If somebody's speaking on the se the television, they're not gonna stop and say remote, okay. So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word Like the t like the telephone. No because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home, and the telephone called immediately so well, that's kinda cute. From from your side uh, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. What do they want? Uh, a risk, take a risk on the market? Something that's gonna cost more, but could very easily s make a boom in the market? Because it has to be something totally different, has to be total totally new. Something that nobody has right now. And it's gonna cost. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. Obviously. If the bottom line is positive. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm. Hmm. Individual actions. She's objecting. Oh th we s we still have Yeah. Right. Agreed.
Yep. Sure. No, this is the third slide. Sure. Um. You're participant s Two? Do you want the mouse, or do you want me to Mm-hmm. Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? 'Cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, whereas having something like, I dunno, steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, yeah. No, I just wondering whether that you had any sort of Yeah. The marketing comes out. That's Christine's. And that's mine, I think. In modified. S 'scuse me for one sec. Hmm. It seems also like with the speech recognition, yeah, it's a great feature, but if you're watching T_V_, there's a lot of ambient sound, and it's words. It's not just, you know, noises like something hitting. It's actual speech, so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech, and the the user's speech. Otherwise, you can say remote. But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing, all of a sudden, you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies, because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_. So, I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems, then yeah, it'd be a really good marketing gimmick. But, I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements. Yeah. Um well, I mean, maybe if I go through my presentation, you can sort of see what the user perspective is, and how it ties into the other two comments. Mm participant three. Nope, here Good. Thanks. Yeah, and that's fine. Okay. So, basically, the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. So, in our case, existing remote controls. And then, what the good ideas are, and what the bad ideas are, and why they're bad and good, which isn't always as obvious. We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that's not the case. Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work. Um and then what the remote control should look like, obviously, once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are. So, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off. You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever. So, the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls, in general. The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. Um often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, um which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. And that the buttons are too small. So, here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side, you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. The buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny. Um they're hard to see, and okay, they're labelled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. Whereas, on the other side, you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. So, I would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons. So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit, or to a minimum, sorry, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed, so like the on button being really obvious one, the channel changing and the volume, and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. Which, I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably. Um so, that's pretty much it, an I don't know if you guys have any questions or Yep. Yes, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's definitely a very important factor, especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases, I think. Oh Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, but do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? Sure. Mm-hmm. I thought No, I I'm just thinking in terms of time, like if Yes, now I'm objecting. No, I mean, I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, but I guess Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay.
'Kay, do you wanna open the I'm number two. That's it. I'll do the notes. Yeah, thanks. So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements, and from my experience, I wanna uh, and from research I did, uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button, you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point, you know. Really have It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it. Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. So uh, I also, since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those, and, as I said in the first meeting, um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction, especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance, and it is reliable, and so forth. I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth, so, I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic, which I kinda like the idea, 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off, that might be interesting. And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off, and the sound on and off, and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today, uh fifty years later. And uh it was really a pioneering innovation, but it was uh sensitive to the sun, so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems. So, uh I in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind. It'd be easy to find. And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. And since I'm not really um Industrial Designer, I didn't really know what to do with this slide. But um I just took some different uh schematics and I put them into this, and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. I don't know why um we were asked to do this. So, uh personal preferences, um I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here, and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it. I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, and um kind of blend in with things, so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home. Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof, because uh sometimes they fall into cups and, you know, it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that. Um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not, because half the time, I keep pushing on the remote control, and I don't know if it's actually understood my message, so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue. And uh, course I never wanna replace the battery. So, that's those are my f preferences, and that's my presentation. Yes. Run over it with a car. Good idea. Good idea, I'll I'll uh um Yes, very good. Hmm. Titanium. Titanium would be be heavy, too, wouldn't it? No, I haven't really um I wanted feedback, I think we need to rate rank these, but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts. I like titanium. It's light. Uh yeah but uh who who said who said we were, you know, nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is, so um It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though. Not fat? Not fat, huh. Might be hard to find, though. Oh, okay. Speech recognition?. D uh I'm sorry? Well, uh training is always an issue with uh commands. So um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process, uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost. Not sure how. But um anyway, um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life. And um so, maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh y you know sen send power to it. So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh, you know, gets uh, from the light, um a a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things. Off. Very good point. Okay, we'll find that out. Oh, it's um, seems very understandable. Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction, and um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it. So uh, you know, but that's okay. That's why we're all here at the table, so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary. I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh, when you hold it, is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about, th th the look and the feel, and uh, you're First. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I don't have any questions. Sounds good. Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance? Doesn't really tell us. Well it says individual actions, it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept, supposed to work on the user interface concept, and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach. I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process, that's my suggestion. You can object if you want to I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out. Somebody else has go to use this room, and, you know, we can't hang out here and talk about this, so Thank you very much.
@highlight
actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting .
@highlight
and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you .
@highlight
And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder .
@highlight
And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .
@highlight
the agenda of the meeting is opening .
@highlight
Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management , and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both , to take the minutes of the meeting .
@highlight
And there are three presentations .
@highlight
One is uh new project requirements .
@highlight
And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions .
@highlight
And uh finally we are closing .
@highlight
Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , management come with the new proposal , and I have to discuss a few points on this .
@highlight
Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project .
@highlight
Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology .
@highlight
we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design .
@highlight
And the second one is about uh the remote control .

@highlight
if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .
@highlight
because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , and the kids throw it if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ?
@highlight
'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable .
@highlight
Titanium would be be heavy , too , um I wanted feedback , but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .
@highlight
I like titanium .
@highlight
Expensive nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though .
@highlight
because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .
@highlight
I know the project plan and the budget .
@highlight
I will I will send you a mail , At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro .
@highlight
and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side .
@highlight
that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price how much its cost for the manufacturing This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ .
@highlight
And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion .
@highlight
and it will be slim , Might be hard to find , though .
@highlight
But let's try it , okay , with the different uh the designs , okay , the functional designs .
@highlight
from the marketing yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro .
@highlight
For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market .
@highlight
in the recent surveys , uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .
@highlight
Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price .
@highlight
Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , then it w it could possibly sell .
@highlight
But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .
@highlight
And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote .
@highlight
Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands .
@highlight
louder , softer , on , off .
@highlight
Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use .
@highlight
So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly .
@highlight
Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time .
@highlight
So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible .
@highlight
But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design .
@highlight
But , price obviously we have to talk about .
@highlight
What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ?
@highlight
training is always an issue with uh commands .
@highlight
uh But um anyway , um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life .
@highlight
maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly or maybe uh set it out in the sun I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech .
@highlight
Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear .
@highlight
I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television .
@highlight
what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project .
@highlight
we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what today .
@highlight
From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise .
@highlight
What do they want ?
@highlight
Uh , a risk , take a risk on the market ?
@highlight
Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?
@highlight
Because it has to be something totally different , but end of the day , you're the sales guy , It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , they want something uh new , I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products .
@highlight
So , in our case , existing remote controls .
@highlight
We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case .
@highlight
Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , Um and then what the remote control should look like , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off .
@highlight
You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing .
@highlight
You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever .
@highlight
the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general .
@highlight
The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do .
@highlight
Um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often .
@highlight
here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .
@highlight
The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny .
@highlight
they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much .
@highlight
Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed .
@highlight
And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it .
@highlight
So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .
@highlight
And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons .
@highlight
So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .
@highlight
Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction , the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .
@highlight
I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , that's for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .
@highlight
Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ?
@highlight
Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ?
@highlight
it says individual actions , so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends .
@highlight
Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach .
@highlight
I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ?
@highlight
I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , 'cause w our meeting time has run out .","```

ES2010d.json,"Me too. Okay. Um here's the agenda for our last meeting. Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation, then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote. Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process, and then we're gonna close it up, and we have forty minutes, so let's get started. Oh, no, let's have the prototype presentation. Right. Hmm. Yeah. Great. Okay. Okay. And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand, is it gonna be a single or a double? Single. Single sounds good, 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double. Great. Great. I think you did an awesome job. It is beautiful, and it's everything that we discussed. Good job. Alright what's next in our agenda? Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria, and that's with Courtney. Right. Mm. Right. Sqi Right. Right. 'Kay. I'll wait. Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say? Just orally. Why not? We have okay. Um easy to use. I vote six. Oh, two. Uh hello, we're great. Um one. No. Me too, very chic. One, I give it a one. Oh, and ma it's a prototype, right. Well, now I'm. So, the average is about a two. Two or three. Two point five. Imagine, since we obviously don't have that. And it's i it is very ergonomically designed. It's gonna be curved. Yeah. I think so too. 'Kay. Two. Alright, average is two. Is it technologically innovative? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here. Go right ahead. Yes. Right? We were able to do it with that kind of chip. Yeah, right. That was 'kay. And we discussed that being included. Well we don' have the you know, we can't say channel, and it changes the channel, channel eight. Right. Okay. Yeah. I'd go for a three or four on that one, so okay, let's go for a three point five. Alright, and the last criteria is it is it um Well, we've covered that with the trendy. Sure. Capable. Very capable. And it's very important. 'Kay, there we go. So. Next. It does. Very good. Alright, let's go back to this No, that's it. Hmm. Oops. Okay, so now uh we're moving on to finance, okay. I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro. If so, we can proceed, if not, we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit. 'Kay? So let me bring that up. Here we go. Alright. Um it's not hand dynamo, it's powered by battery, so we give it a Number of components you plan to use. Do I just put quantity being one battery, or Yeah. But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s, 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery. Oh, let's just go for a lithium. What do you say? I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right. Okay, down to the electronics um section. We're gonna need this kind, correct, if we do the voice sensor, so one of those. It is a single-curved, so one of those. Oh. What's that? Yeah, that's correct. 'Kay, down here, case material. Plastic. 'Kay. Down here, interface type. We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel. Isn't oh those are just regular buttons. This? Okay, so we can just go um. Right I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here? Right. I don't know, they might put us well, let's just. Two or would it be three? Okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay. Are they? Oh, right. Mm. Well, we're under cost then. Alright. No, we're under. Twelve point five is our limit. We've got eleven point two. Alright. We can go to I dunno what I just did. Okay. Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result. Um did we have a lot of room for creativity? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership, um teamwork, and the means, meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there, and if we found any new ideas. Now, question is, how do we do this? Discuss, sure. Alright. Who want who would like to go first? Hmm. Hmm. And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though? Right, and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable, which I kind of like we yep. You know it. Um what about um the teamwork aspect? How did you guys enjoy making the model, the prototype? I think ya' did. Did you work well together in there, and 'kay. Oh my God, and we've all been a pretty congenial team here, I think. We hadn't had any ma fallings out. Irritating. Okay. Yeah. I have to knock that one down a couple notches. Yeah, digital pens. They were fine. Right, laptops are extremely handy, wireless. And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the Big brother. 'Kay, have we found any new ideas through this process? For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically. And that's your right brain taking over, w wanting the artistic, the fashionable, the hip, you know. If we all just went out and bought useful things, I don't think I mean that's not what technology. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Just the Mac font bothers me even. But I do like iPods, go figure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Colours. Exactly. I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone, back when we were like in high school, just so they could get the changeable face plates. Okay. Anyway, so that is definitely at work. Yeah. Fashionable chic people will. Hmm. There you go, marketing. Alright. Okay, we're gonna wrap this up now. Um the costs are within the budget, we evaluated the project, and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary, and then we're going to have a big giant party, apparently, according to this, so. Alright, thank you team, you did a great job, it was lovely working with you.
I wanna find our if our remote works. Oh. Whoohoo. That's nice. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful Yeah. Good job, you guys. Those are really good. Okay, it's a PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about. It's under evaluation. Alright. Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask, is it easy to use, is it fashionable uh yeah, I guess we should write these down so we can reference them. Like does it feel good, like yeah, physically. That's just for current trend. It doesn't really count, you guys. Yeah. But it's so we do have removable covers, right? Yeah, well then that's covered. And so we n k everybody have that? Yeah, she's got it. It's good. Yeah. Okay so, we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale, and so we need to discuss how we feel. It falls within this range, so for easy to use, do we feel it's very easy to use? You guys Okay. Oh wait, that's false. Okay. Two. That's what I say. Okay, fashionable? No. I mean like no, I think it's very fashionable. I thi I would give it a one. Well, that's that's just like that's a clay, it's a prototype. What do you think? Okay. Yeah, it's a two. That's okay. Yeah. Um does it feel good? I feel like I think it feels good. I'll give it a two. What do you say? Okay. Oh no, it's fine, you're I mean you're Project Manager. Um yeah, I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it? And there's no way you can represent it on here. Y Yeah, so. Then yes, then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative? And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_, so I'd probably give it a three. Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced. But it is just a T_V_ remote. Well yeah, so I'd give it a two. Oh, it's very capable of being squishy and fruity. Yeah. Okay, next. So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner, and uh hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job, team. What? It it does. Thanks. Two. Yeah. Yeah, let's let's do a lithium. We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced, yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. We plastic. And special colour. But it's Yeah, but i so i But will we w actually we'll need two, won't we? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side. Okay. Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button. There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides. So is that gonna be an extra one on each side? Or three, because of one on each side and one on top. I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine. Well less than twenty nine even. They're a special colour. Um they're uh they're a special form, 'cause they're indented. And, they're a special material. We're under. I think we just discuss it. Oh that's true. Yeah. No, yeah, that's a good point. 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision, yeah. Oh, overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it. And we're a fashion forward technology company. Minus that one fight. Yeah. Yeah. I mean minus you guys being wha what is it, the survey, annoying or what is it? Irritating, yeah. Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one. Yeah. Yeah, and no internet. And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool. Yeah they were fun, even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome. Yeah. And these things whoa. Yeah. And Big Brother. Yeah. Um we are really gonna sell this. Ta-da. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause they're pretty and just like Uh yeah. Yeah, no, iPods They want all those words for presentation, even the plugs. Oh yeah, everybody. Mine is amber. Oh. Look at it. That is a piece of work. Wow. Marketing Director says yeah. Fashionable people will buy it. Oh, I will create desire. We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial, and that's the fig-leaf. Mm. That'll sell. Yeah. Yeah. You too.
Um sure. You or me? Okay. Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for, I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you. The base is gonna be gunmetal gray, which is what we had decided, and it's gonna be plastic. Um then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red. Um because it can be replaceable, we just kinda went with the colour. Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue, almost see-through. It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow. The whole thing lights up if you press any button, rather than it just that one button will light up. Um and then at the bottom we have our logo. Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. They're one button, but they kind of push up and down. I don't think they're scrolling. Right, yeah. And then yeah, the buttons. Thumb-shaped. Yeah. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top, just which we didn't do. Single. Right. Oh thank you. Feel good meaning what? Physically, okay. Yeah. True or false, easy to use. Yeah. Yeah, two. Mm I don't think it's that fashionable. I'd give it like three or four. But then I'm not fashionable, so don't use my opinion. Does it feel good? Yeah, it's gonna be thicker. Depth. I'll give it a one. Oh right, the Right. Yeah I go four. Squishy and fruity. It's just trendy, basically. Okay. It's plastic. And special colour. No, we don't have the scroll. Buttons. Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons. But we don't have any scrolls. Two interfaces, is that what w should we s say? Okay, fine. Yeah. And then s yeah. We're over? Okay. Oh, I see. We didn't have a whiteboard. Yeah. And no internet. I think we did well. Yep. Gouges. Irritating. And no internet. Misses. I do. There's so much available. Like it's information Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples, just 'cause I look at it, and I know it's probably a very good computer, but I look at it, and I'm taken back to elementary school, 'cause they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school, and that's so old-fashioned to me. Exactly, so I associate them with like really low-tech, really cheap, bad Yeah. But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs. You're kidding. No, no. No, marketing has to actually create the desire for it. Ri They'll be sexy with it. Oh right. Let you loose. Yeah, no. Good.
Mm 'kay, you ready? Y you read that stuff, since you wrote it. I'll be the Vanna. No. They're just buttons. On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of, by concave sort of thing, except for, you know, can't see underneath. So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that, because they're very nice to stock you know, stick your finger in. Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used, menu, mute, and then these are the numbers, so our channel and our volume will be on either side. I'd say a single. Yeah, it's only actually the size of my hand. Whoohoo. Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Yes. I'd say two as well. At the moment, no. Okay. I'll give it a two, because at the moment it's not looking that way. Neither are all o all the customers we have, either. Uh the shape of it actually does uh. I'd say a two. We could do it with the chip, yes. It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype, but that's because it's only two dimensions, really. It Yeah. Three and an half. It's capable of being squishy and fruity. How did you get that in there? The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie. That was good. Yep. Mm 'kay. Yeah, it's. Yep. Well, that's the push-button too, right there. Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button. We're really having just push-button interface. But it that just covers the type of button we're having. Because we're not doing a scroll on the side, it's still push-button. Push-button. But we just have push Yeah. Okay. Let's call it th Okay. Grand. So we can go to production. Go back. Previous. We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote, initially. right. Yeah. Well, no, there was there was scratching and fighting, but no. Irritating. The means, the whiteboard didn't work. A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet. I really appreciated those, yeah. The use of the laptops for receiving everything. It was wireless too, so. And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear. The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids. Well, i iPods are now quite trendy, and they come in different colours. Yeah. Not me. I didn't have a phone 'til university. That's okay. We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met. This will help them find the one. That's right. And so the serpent says, use our remote. Whoohoo. Margaritas for everyone. Yay. Thanks to the Project Leader. Now we know w

ES2008c.json,"Yep. Uh-huh. Don't think so. Jess. Alright, so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device. Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface. We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable. Um other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose. Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control, so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people. We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um, but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work, how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device. Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concept, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features. And of course we also have to make it look cool. So basically, that's what we don't want. M we don't want lots of buttons, uh complicated features. We want something that looks nice and simple. Here's a a fairly simple device. This is an an iPod from Apple. Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons. It's very minimalistic in its design. Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen. Um the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features. Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track, next track and play pause. They're the main the main features of the iPod, the things you will use a all the time. Um then if you want to do anything more advanced, you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want. So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have. Um here's a another example. This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool. Um it's certainly got novelty value. Uh it's nice and colourful, it's nice and bright. Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around. The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which and basically, yeah it's ith it's fun. So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often. So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels. I mean most people, when they watch T_V_, they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most. So, you have buttons for your favourite channel, changing the volume, which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_, and the button to switch it off, in case you get bored. Um other features, things like adjusting the brightness, tuning the T_V_, uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_. Um but these are these are all necessary functions. Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast, so we need to find a way of including these somehow. Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system, a bit like on the iPod. So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself, or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device. And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often. I think that's that's one way to go, yes. Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display, it's it's nice, because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair. There are disadvantages, an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small, 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device. Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it, 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark, but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display. The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control. Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel. I mean that that's also a good idea. It's it can it does have it's problems as well, if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room, it's hard to read the little text that comes up. Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that would be one of the features, yes. But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way, so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control, at least I don't think you can. Um I'm not sure. Is that going on? Okay. Uh that should be alright, actually. A kind of thing that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? Uh like uh I dunno, like uh carrots or something. Maybe, or Kind of like a potato. Yeah. Depends. When you when you use a remote, do you press the buttons with your thumb, usually? Or your fingers? Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone, so you you hold it in one hand, and you press the buttons with your thumb. Yeah. Maybe. But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway, then it's it's not so much a problem, perhaps. So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and And you find that works quite well? Is that The button on an iPod, is it what is it, is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing? Right. Oh, I see, right, yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's quite a good design. Yeah. I think it could be difficult in practice, yeah. Also z yeah, 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen, than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that. Like, to make it different fruits. Yeah, it's possible. I think maybe th the packaging, it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel. So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it, and the remote control's inside. Don't know. Yeah, um I think it's good, as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is, but as far as I know, the technology is good. Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same, I think. Uh it's fairly fairly standard. Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel. I mean it might be nice for changing the volume. Uh but I don't think it would really work. Yeah, you really need buttons for changing a channel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think yeah, I think a scroll wheel would be nice, but it's not necessary. Um Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yep. Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down, we should just go for pushbuttons, 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler, it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button. So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons. Yeah, yeah, it's uh it's it's fairly simple. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yep. Uh what do you mean by supplements, exactly? Um Yep. Yeah. Um in Yeah. On off, uh volume, favourite channels, uh and menu. Yeah, yeah about yeah like yeah, a bit like radio presets. Um Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers. I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned. Yeah, yeah, you can just and you need some kind of, I dunno, sort of up down kind of button, but the volume control could double for that, for example. Cool. Yep. Clay. I wasn't expecting that.
Fourteen twenty six. Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing? Okay. 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like, you know, like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing, but I've no idea. Sounds good. Thanks. Wait, but is that separate from what he was saying? Should I plug that in? Maybe it's just not Is it on? Ri What F_ do you have to press, five? I just keep pressing lots of 'em. Well, I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be. If anything, the that they gave me. Alright. Oh yeah. Okay, so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching. Basically, I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted, and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year. So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls, and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference, but that really, over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes, so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so, even though we're stressing, when we're talking, we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea, they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel. And as these are ranked, the top one is doubly important to the second one, which is doubly important to the third one, so just to take that weight into account. The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations. That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen, things like that. And then ease of use was the third most important, whi so really, no matter what, we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel, according to this. I don't know how much we agree with that. And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes, shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy, tight material. And so that brings us to my personal preferences. Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding. Personally, I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale, excuse the pun, um in a year, so even though this is coming from us as, you know, trend watch, market research, I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away. Also, considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction, I'm a little hesitant as to like, how these questions may have been worded, and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking. Personally, like I might reverse it, but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what, we have to stress fashion the most. But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material. Yeah. I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them, that pretty much sums it up. So yeah. Yeah, what can I possibly enlighten on? Mm-hmm. Yeah, so something, m m instead of a necess yeah, grip, I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands, you know, i and I think I'm envisioning more like, you know, the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle, so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time, like I'm imagining that sort of thing, I don't know what th that material's called. Oh God. What about the idea of like a round remote? Instead of like a vertical up and down one. Like in terms of holding it. Like that's a f shape of a fruit. Just to tie it in a little. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around. But I like i I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod. 'Cause th It's like five, 'cause there's one in the middle. I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume. Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things, but then how you could go back to the menu and like, I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_. I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_, 'cause if you're changing the brightness, don't you wanna see it happening, kind of? And then you could still have that available. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables, I'll let you know. Well, there we go. The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun. It's like the way it all comes all cute. Lemons? Yeah, I mean, it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries. Costs. But over time Yeah, it's a But if you c if you could scroll through the channels, and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way, forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. And otherwise, no matter how may buttons we have, we're gonna have like, you know, black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up. Oh could it be hard, and then something around it? I'm thinking curved of some sort. Yeah. And let's like see if we get anything else. I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel, it's more just to give it a different kind of look, but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool, then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel. Like a radio type sorta situation? Wow.
Mm yeah. Okay. That would be me. Alright. Well. Alright. Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it. Components design. This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of. Um. So, we need to examine each element separately, but we're designing a full thing, so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole. The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. These are all things that we had sort of addressed before, but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like. The case, uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do, um there's there's the shape of a case, we could do a flat sh a flat case, a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet, just keep that in mind, but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic, the m the main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber or other coloured types of plastic. That would be our case. Um buttons, for buttons we have um pushbuttons, which is what Real Reaction uses the most often, but we also have scror scroll wheels, which can have integrated pushbuttons, or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen. Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one, a regular one or an advanced one, depending on what our other needs are. And then battery I think is where things get most exciting. We're talking about long-life batteries here. Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries, but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery, like are used in high-tech watches, where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up. Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery. Or a solar battery, although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery. Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago, flashlights. Not quite sure what that is, but that's the description that I received, so that's what I'm passing on to you. So those are our options. Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through, fashion and simplicity. So if we're going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case, probably with a variety of design elements. Maybe titanium, maybe some wood. We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials, but that's sort of what I have in mind. And we wanna go for simplicity. Probably pushbuttons, but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel, if anyone has anything any ideas on that? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing, so that might be something we wanna look into. And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery. Solar I don't think would be such a good idea, because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light. But this idea of the kinetic, that you don't have to replace, and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work, I think that that m would be a very interesting thing. But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down. Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_. So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be, 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down. That's what I have for options. Um I'd appreciate anyone's input, but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing. I'm not sure. I haven't received any specific visuals of this yet. This is what I'm sort of Yeah. I'm not sure, but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures. I know if we do have a double-curved case, it can't have any titanium in it. But the titanium, they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme, so that could be quite interesting. Space-age remote. Just all things to keep in mind. Yeah. That's about all I have to do, guys. I hope I didn't go through that too quickly. Yeah, n no idea, no idea. Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight, and that a tita titanium is very light, I know, um but other than that's really basic, I mean, that's all I have gotten so far. Alright? Any other questions? No? Okay. I have save this in the uh shared projects, if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well, if anyone needs any more information. Uh Just in my notebook, but if anyone has any specific questions, don't hesitate to email me or something. Alright? Uh I guess I can I know. G oh, geez. Hmm. Hmm. So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then? Okay. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Well Are you are you tak Yeah. No, I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly, rather than menu as what's on. Oh, good point. Yeah. No signal. Oop, there we go. Okay. Mm. That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though. If it's latex if it's latexy Um, mean An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, but that it's covered with the latex, which is spongier and softer on your hands. It's there's something to be said, I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and and Yeah, something grippable, I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy, maybe. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable. could we go in fruit and vegetable colours? We could colour-co-ordinate them, li The buttons could be fruit-shaped. Oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it? Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits. be yeah. It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think. It'd be harder to press button. Um I Yeah, that's ts how I tend to do it. No just thumb-sized. Jus Yeah. That's true. Right. I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod, that's how I do it, hold it and press the four. Yeah. Yeah, or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel. Yeah It wel well yeah, it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different, but Oh yeah, you had one of the in-between ones, when they weren't doing that anymore. Ts and you press the centre button, that's that's your all-purpose select button right there. Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked, yeah. Yeah. Uh uh t Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory, but not as useful in practice. Yeah. Right. Um Oh we probably have to get going, don't we? 'Kay. Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colours, yeah. Exactly. And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever. All these options. Ooh. Oh. Yeah. Mm. Options. Uh-hu oh, oh yes. Right, I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but um Alright, so um decisions, what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery. Um I dunno, what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? Am I Yeah. Yeah. Right, I haven't gotten any yeah, any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery, but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip, then it'll even out, I think. Um circuit boards. Um yeah, I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced. They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them, and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine, which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions. I wasn't really given any options, I was just given that this is how they're done. Um yeah, I can't can't really tell you. I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works. But I don't know any decisions on Yeah. I'm sorry, I did f Yeah. Right. Well okay, here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got. Um simple, regular, advanced chip on print. The chip on print includes an infrared sensor, so we don't have to worry about that. Um, 'kay, the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and an L_C_D_ requires advanced. Do we want a scroll wheel, or do we just want pushbuttons? Oh. Yeah, th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices, than you can scroll down on the scroll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. F or for all those secret functions? When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus. Right. So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip, depending and maybe we could table that decision for later. I don't know. Okay. Well, let's think about that while we talk about the case. Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex, if if spongy is the in thing. Okay. Uh yeah, everything I've N oh wha what I've what I've seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside, and it's just covered with the latex. Not too thick a layer of latex, just enough to be grippable, like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that. The inside is hard. I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board, I think that that's done for us. Yeah. Yeah. Oh and we want a curved case, yeah? Or a double-curved? Yeah, okay. We don't really know what the difference Good point. Yeah. I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton, but it's gotta be some more expensive, so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case because Yeah. Oh. Alright. So what are what are our buttons gonna be? On off So like one through five, or No. Mm. Yeah, up down. Ooh. Simple chip. Okay, cool. Clay.
Mm-hmm. Okay. I g yeah. Time is it? Okay. Lovely to see you all again. Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock. Um okay our agenda, we're gonna do an opening, I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting, then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts, and finally we'll close. So opening. Um these are our minutes from r the functional design. We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it, because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups, different um functions of it. Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion. And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost, large buttons for the essential functions, a possibility for extra functions, like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station. Okay, now three presentations. I'd like to do it in this order, first do the conceptual specification of components, properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching. Mm. 'kay. Function F_ eight it. There we go. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah, I wonder Mm-hmm. Just an interesting marketing kind of element. Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements, have you no idea, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm 'kay. Thank you, perfect. Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh, uh in your book, then don't worry about that. 'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface. Yeah, um. This one's so much tighter than the other one. Okay. Nope. There we go. Here you are. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on. Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable, but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. Like I I know I use that often enough. Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote, I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a Okay. Okay. 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box, mm-hmm. Mm. Okay, now we're moving on to market. Marketing. Eight. Oops, it's not plugged in, quite in well enough. There we are. Mm 'kay. S sweet. Okay, do we have any s some questions for this, let's see um. Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all? Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote? It would be easier on the hands. It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that, I dunno. But Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. F for sure, or maybe like um couple main ones being like, I dunno, lemons or strawberries or something. Could they be smelly? I don't know. Or carrot shaped, mm. Like large button, that's what I was thinking of, yeah. Might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is yeah. Harder to push. I usually hold it in one hand. Maybe But then the buttons would have to be very small. Don't you think? But I mean in order to get to all of them, you know. They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's a scroll, yeah, it's a wheel. The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it, I don't think. Mm. Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left, so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation. Um I've one more slide before we close, but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things, so I'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on. Um Yeah, and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium. Ah hmm hmm hmm. Okay, um components concept. Energy, chip on print. G That's th th this is the agenda they gave me. So can you just explain what that is real quick? Mm-hmm. I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. Okay. If they're if they're really options. Okay. Um okay, then we'll move on to the case. Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple, a regular, or an advanced chip, maybe. It would be nice for changing the volume, but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel. 'Cause you don't have control over numbers or We have five minutes left for the meeting, so. So, have a scroll for volume? F Um. I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface, we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not. Okay, let's do case. I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it, because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside. Um Yeah, I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Ge o Okay. So we uh we do want latex. Okay. Latex. Um and probably in colours, maybe fruity, vegetable colours. Fruity colours. Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose. Well, we don't really know what the difference is, right? Yeah. Um okay, interface, the type and the supplements. So push or scroll, right? Or both? Mm-hmm. And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through, like you can use your buttons to scroll through things. I think that yeah. For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast, I dunno. Mm-hmm. Is that okay with you? How you feeling? Mm-hmm. It might be cool enough. Okay, so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons, and then supplements, how are we gonna do that? Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use. So we're gonna have like a menu button, so that we can access on-screen things then? Okay, um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through. Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero, right? Well, but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through. Mm-hmm. Okay, um finishing the meeting now. Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes, um you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation, and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach. Um did we decide on a chip? Let's go with a simple chip? Okay. We are done. Thank you everyone. Oh I di these are already in our shared folder, so.

So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements .
@highlight
Maybe titanium , maybe some wood .
@highlight
We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , And we wanna go for simplicity .
@highlight
Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery .
@highlight
But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down .
@highlight
Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ .
@highlight
Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ?
@highlight
I'm not sure .
@highlight
but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures .
@highlight
I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it .
@highlight
um the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , no idea .
@highlight
Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something .
@highlight
I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .
@highlight
so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are We have a number of different choices for a design concept um Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features .
@highlight
Here's a a fairly simple device .
@highlight
This is an an iPod from Apple .
@highlight
Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen .
@highlight
So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have .
@highlight
Um here's a another example .
@highlight
and I think i it looks pretty cool .
@highlight
Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright .
@highlight
if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .
@highlight
we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow .
@highlight
So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?
@highlight
I think that's that's one way to go , Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .
@highlight
Uh but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it .
@highlight
I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .
@highlight
we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching .
@highlight
that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .
@highlight
and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel .
@highlight
And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations .
@highlight
And then ease of use was the third most important , And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material .
@highlight
And so that brings us to my personal preferences .
@highlight
Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding .
@highlight
Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking .
@highlight
Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .
@highlight
Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?
@highlight
Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ?
@highlight
could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ?
@highlight
If it's latex if it's latexy my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ?
@highlight
um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .
@highlight
I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ?
@highlight
Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something .
@highlight
Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .
@highlight
What about the idea of like a round remote ?
@highlight
Instead of like a vertical up and down one .
@highlight
Like in terms of holding it .
@highlight
Like that's a f shape of a fruit .
@highlight
would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ?
@highlight
I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod .
@highlight
or is it li more like a scroll thing ?
@highlight
and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there .
@highlight
I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .
@highlight
I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .
@highlight
Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ?
@highlight
In different fruit and vegetable colours , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex components concept .
@highlight
Energy , chip on print .
@highlight
can you just explain what that is real quick ?
@highlight
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?
@highlight
I think it's awesome .
@highlight
I think it's really cool .
@highlight
as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced .
@highlight
which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .
@highlight
Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think .
@highlight
I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions .
@highlight
I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .
@highlight
if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , Do we want a scroll wheel , Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel .
@highlight
It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel .
@highlight
you really need buttons for changing a channel .
@highlight
We have five minutes left for the meeting , so .
@highlight
and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking .
@highlight
When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .
@highlight
I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary .
@highlight
Um Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .
@highlight
could it be hard , and then something around it ?
@highlight
I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .
@highlight
what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex .
@highlight
Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .
@highlight
and we want a curved case , Or a double-curved ?
@highlight
Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , So we're gonna have like a menu button , we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .
@highlight
uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu .
@highlight
Pre-set channels I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned .
@highlight
finishing the meeting now .
@highlight
Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
@highlight
You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .
@highlight
Let's go with a simple chip ?
@highlight
Um did we decide on a chip ?
@highlight
but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .","**Meeting Agenda: TV Remote Control Design Project Update**

ES2009d.json,"All set? Cool. Alright, it is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun. So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um, I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting. I think. I don't know. Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes, s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, uh, I will open them slowly, no? Wait for it, wait for it. No. That's how the Wait. This is, this is very high-powered stuff here, double-clicking, there we go. So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, uh or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under, what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition, I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. Um, and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at. So. That's sorted, back to the main meet here, um, go ahead and take it away guys. Mm-hmm. Nice. Perfect. Oh, right. Oh well done yeah, yeah oh ok Edible televisions, it's a wave of the future. Brilliant. Brilliant. Cool. No, no I think that's Right, yeah thanks guys that's very, very good work. I like it, brilliant. Um, what we need to discuss now is the finance of it, um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance. Um, it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um. I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly, but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this it's a solar cell thing right? With a back-up battery? With the ba okay. Um and Clever, clever, well done. Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it? Okay. Um and the case, it's more of a single-curved case, I guess would be that be the general Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Um. Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we? Um. And um a special I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout, yeah. Yeah, it's it's quite unique. I like it, yeah it's So it looks like a bit over budget, um. So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery. Uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. What's difficult, we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now, it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way. Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it, um It's either or. 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm, um, nor would changing the case materials. Um. So yeah that looks like to be the only thing. So that would be the it's a major change but Yeah. Alright, so we're in agreement on that. Right. Moving along swiftly. Um, so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over. Ah of course, sorry. Whoosh. That'd be great Brilliant. Hmm. Um yeah, I was just go on. Well they don't own tellys anyway do they? Right. So, um, this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair, um. I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to. Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report. So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked, I guess, um. I think so yeah. I think it's I mm-hmm, I think so. I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment. But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough. Um right, um so any thoughts? Yeah. What do you guys feel about the process? Mm-hmm. No, no whiteboard. Was pretty cool tack though. Attempts to contact coach ineffective. Very natural look. That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here. Yeah, I think, yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually, I mean. Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern. What did you guys think about the the the roles? That's true, I I got this spreadsheet. Of what to do. Mm, mm. Cool. She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it. I felt like I slipped into it a lot. I dunno. The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management. I usually organise crap, it's one thing to do, you know set up a party with your friends, you know? But you guys felt that you could keep the, yeah, suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay? Yeah, yeah. Maybe in in Legos you know? Be fun with Legos too, like make a remote control or spaceship, we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever. Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all? Hmm. No I, no I dunno, I d I I dunno, I don't I I was just I It's true huh? Yeah. Yeah. Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like, kind of like, like hmm. It d But yeah. Interesting. It's kind of fascinating wasn't it? I mean the whole process of I don't know. I I don't know if there was a ri I th Mm. Nor I. I wanna see the output files from these um, from the digital paper. I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap. I mean, just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something. T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like. You know, like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here. I dunno, I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about. Well, that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there, mm-hmm. I didn't change this one at all. Um ch Yeah well. W I kinda like th Yeah you can't Yeah. Does kinda make you wonder, I mean, how much can you do with a remote control? It's like inventing a new car. Yeah yeah, you can Yeah. Hmm. Um. 'Kay. So this was other costs. I dunno. I think this is forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval, um. I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing. Like, what like you know what am I really doing, you know what is Yep. Hey. Mm. I actually didn't do that at all though, every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em. I di Oh. What? Really? Did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this? Like with this was what it looks like. This is what that looked like, literally, just like that. Interesting. Uh-huh huh huh. Interesting. Any other thoughts come to mind? Yeah but Builds. Mm. Interesting. Uh, yeah, I'd say so. Mm, I know. It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically. You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing, the whole concepts phase, I don't think I really understood like the concept. Well the id okay the notion of yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material, it's just it is what it is. You know, maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of um like proposed idea. And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever, I dunno. But. All in all it's kinda interesting. No just this closing one. No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget, but we could s you know do it We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches and Mm. True. Yeah. 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it. Um. Yeah. And it's all recorded, woo-hoo. Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff, like because and if and so forth, but I'll put most of it in the reports. Nice. Oh yeah. There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that, psycholinguistics. Yep, they're called um disfluencies. Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things. Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah I know. Come on give me some information. Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet, so I mean I do the I know, imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet. It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet? I mean, you know, it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time. No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous Mm. Yeah that's our last step. Celebration. 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part. Cool. Where do you find that? Is this one of those media player? W oh. The default track. I thought it was David Burns, look into the eyeball. That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while, maybe this is the new version. Yeah, I guess we'll call that a a doner. Fab.
Ready for this? Oh man. No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will. Um. Right, um, of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there. Um. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption. Um, what other things do we see here, well, um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel, um, so I think that will work well with regards to our market. Um and uh let's see, well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. Um uh do you have anything else to add to that? It's actually important to note that the television, uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that, that i it actually is edible inside. Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh polymer yeah. It's fine. Hmm. It's pos a possible new product. Um, but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote, um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature. Um, did we come in under budget? Mm-hmm. Mm. Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option? So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look. Um, but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with. Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um, I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not. And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um, so. Well we didn't quite have enough material uh. Oh I see, right, um. Right. Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that. So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials which I think worked out fine. We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green. The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area. Yeah. I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that. I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart right? And the reality is you know, for me from an ideological stand point, I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell, but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell. Savings. No, I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah. Yep. They like that spongy feel. And the paging function works well, that's good to hear, we worked hard on that one. W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're I guess that's true. We didn't use the whiteboard at all. And Um, also had I not been intrigued about the pen, I don't think I woulda used it at all, I didn't write barely anything. Uh. Yeah. I so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity, we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us, um. With the natural look. I think the teamwork was good as well. Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more, which was fine. Mm-hmm. And I think your leadership was quite good. An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role? I had to admit, as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh, th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window. Possibly. Oh yeah, still have 'em. Yep. I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team. Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board. I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for. Um, because I've got this laptop. Standard, I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me. So is this all we need to get through? Is it Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts? What is that? Our limited ability to think outside the box? Why? Huh I think it was the real. Yeah. Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning. Oh I added like five slides too, but I Yeah, mine too. No. I added many slides every time Yeah. Um. Even you. Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications. I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar that happened to be consumed. So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups, especially between culture groups and what not. Mm. What the uhs and the Mm. That's scary yeah? Well just around that eight or or nine people that are Dude, I think we've had internet for like eighteen years. In the eighties? Right. Yeah, it was to the like seven universities or something. You guys ready to celebrate? Celebrate. There is another one. Huh? Yep.
Okay. Oh I totally Yeah 'cause I moved it. 'S put it over here. Then we don't have to worry about it. Huh. Yeah that's not you. Ah. Fair enough. Mm. Right. Appropriate, okay. Mm 'kay. It is an option. Ah. I see. Nice. Do we need to worry about um rot factors? Oh okay, there's preservatives involved, we don't need to worry, okay. Fair enough. No but It's a couple years off at least. Okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Right. Do we have um other, for lack of a better word, skins? Covers? In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or? Do we know where we stand on that yet? Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet. Okay. Just veneer really, yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And the whole thing Okay. Right. Yeah. There's Okay. Mm 'kay. Okay, very cool. Okay. Okay. Yep. It's still an option if we need it. Very cool, nice job. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. M come in at sixteen? Yeah. Mm k. True. Nah. Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly. I mean Which, it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market, I mean that's where we started from, so I don't know, and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think unfortunately that's our best option. Mm. It kind of yeah. Mm-mm. Yeah. Unfortunately I think we are. That would be me. Um cord? No problem. Can you reach, that would be great, thank you. I didn't even do that one on purpose either, damn. Okay, um, basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel they're important. Um so I was looking at basic design things, does it fulfil its functions as a remote? Is the design what we wanted it to do? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for? Um. Basic questions like, you know, does it turn on? Does it respond to voice recognition? And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par. Um, the only thing is with with the pull-out panel, that is, can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface, um that looked like it was coming up rough, but then, once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense. So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. So. Yeah. It looks like it's going over well, so we're we're good yeah. Yeah. It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff, but for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for, so it's all good. That's everything from me. Yeah. Yeah, it is a set-back, but Okay, do you need the cord back? As in within the team or? Okay. It is now, you're in charge so there you go. Whatever. Um. I think they're starting blocks yeah. Um, you know I think in general, for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive, considering the little amount of input we had going in. Um, and the technology has definitely been a help, it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff. No, we didn't. We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints, doesn't really matter. Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen, yeah. Mm. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. Yeah, but I didn't get a response so we'll see. Okay that would be kinda creepy. Well what kind of coaching is that really? What if I really needed something. I think so. And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be. Organic, really. And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus. Mm yeah, I'm impressed. Nice. All four of those little containers. Yeah. You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours. Oh well. They were good. Yeah. True. Do your own. Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day. I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all. Nothing, I didn't even get an email, like that was it. So, yeah, I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know, fill in the blanks on your own, level of creativity upped. Whatever. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, that wasn't very much. Mm. Yes. Hmm, very much so. Yeah, already having the formatted stuff helped a lot. Very much so. Hmm. Yeah. That's kind of a good thing though, you know, give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth, other than that I could only imagine. Yeah. Totally. I think so. Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building, but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming, use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work, not like three hours' worth of meetings. That's true. Yeah that is kind of Mine was the mics. I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires, I was afraid I was gonna break something actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True, but it didn't even occur to me as an option, I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't. True. Yeah. Yeah. Well it looks really professional. I know. I know, I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff. Okay, well not entirely, but still, I doodled less than I usually do. I guess. Um. It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that? That slide was like that? Well. Uh I think they still do their job. I am thinking outside the little square box though, with literally in like form I don't Yeah. It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road, you know? Don't know. Kind of. Oh, how long was our meeting supposed to be? How much time do we have left? Mm. Yeah, at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away. You know, you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore. Mm-hmm. Whatever. Yeah. Very much, yeah. See I only got blank ones. My slides were all blank, they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty. Like with those words already on it? No. I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated. I think I added a slide one time. Hey with the whole new background being innovative, yeah that was class. Mm. I wanna know how our product would fare. I can't just leave it there. I think it would take extensive marketing, okay, an apple with a red button on top, even I am sceptical. But you know the whole Yeah. I know it is. Mm. I I noticed that. By accident. Well huh. An interesting day all in all I would say. I know. I Yeah. 'Cause it's such a functional item. Mm. Mm. We got it to be. Like cutting corners. Kind of, though it was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general. Which I'm not sure is the same thing, at the time that just i made more sense, but I could see if they were really asking about us. Yay. Make it sound eloquent. Oh, I have to done I've I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing. There's a guy studying it here, yeah, he's studying ums and ahs or something. Yeah. That's a good word for it. Just add some prefixes, sounds classier. I, yeah, pretty compulsively during meetings, like, yeah. Yeah, we are addicts. Mm. Yeah. I yeah. True. I yeah. But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four, but still. Uh-huh. My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network. There's basically the fundamental structures, but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been partitioned off and stuff, yeah that was him. Apparently, does that include like champagne or something exciting? I think so. I think that's a closer. I have no idea. So is that a close? Okay, that's the end of the meeting. Thank you gentlemen. I feel like I'm signing off.
Yeah. Oh really? Okay. Well. Uh, we have assembled our prototype, um. What's to be said about it? Um, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting, um. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions, um. This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here, d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons. And then, for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away, um. As far as the uh whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out, why not? Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Um. Go ahead. That's this here. Um I worried about the materials, it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh, it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. Um, and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel. Fact, I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen, I thought that was kinda nice. This was actually an apple on the inside. This Yeah. We got a bit ahead of ourselves, I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that, but Right. Uh we did, yeah. This cost well to put this into um production, we're looking at about what was our goal? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine. Um, so I was quite pleased with that. One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons, but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down. So even though it has a lot of modern technology, um for example the voice recognition, in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper. And Oh no, we haven't talked about that yet have we? Hmm. Yeah. Any questions? Um, do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it? Yeah, yeah. Um, well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like It's not it's not quite a a face plate, it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it, it locks into place such that, you know, it's pretty permanent but at the same time, if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean. Yeah. Oh. Ooh. Right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there, yep. Yeah, yeah. It's just making use of the same space and the same materials, but Yeah, one big curve I guess you could say. Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, special. And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, don't you? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional, I like to think of it as unconventional. Oh. Huh, doesn't match up does it? How do you feel about that? I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do? People'd be real upset. I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery, it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Right. Yeah. I guess we might have to do that. It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it? Of twelve fifty. Yeah,. Gotta do what you gotta do. Mm. Really good. Six? We did. I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay. Mm. I know. True. Okay. Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or 'Kay. Yeah. Are we considering these points here? Okay. No. Yeah, it's true. Mm. Definitely. As you write your personal coach. What if you get a response two or three months from now? That'd be weird. Yeah. That's very natural. Yeah. And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh, we used every bit. Yeah, I guess My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with, we only had four, wasn't enough. I know it could have been amazing. Hmm. Yeah it's f kind of fun, it was I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough. At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up, which was kind of fun. Yeah. Mm. You know Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time. It was really good yeah. It's kinda fun. Yeah. Little different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? You don't. Yeah. Yeah. Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board? Yeah, that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or. Yeah, that's it. Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because New ideas. Hmm. I guess we're on the right track. No, none. I think they're fine actually. Yeah, maybe a s a circle would be alright, different. Are we back into project mood? Yeah. Yeah. Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like, you know, not very much. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Did you really? I just got blank ones and Me too. I deleted slides. That was pretty cool, it was a high moment of the whole experiment. I think it would fail, I think it'd be a huge disaster, especially if it looks like that. I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face. It's a happy face. Yeah, it's uh I wanna see a Yeah. Hmm. So we have more slides or? Mm. Hmm. I It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording. Really. Filler words or? Disfluencies. I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot, just out of boredom, like c come on gimme something. It is scary. Yeah. It's crazy. So Should. Has it been forty minutes or whatever? this has been long enough. Is that the only song you have? That's awesome. Maybe I have a different one.
@highlight
here we have our detailed design meeting I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .
@highlight
um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice .
@highlight
That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .
@highlight
the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at .
@highlight
we have assembled our prototype , um .
@highlight
Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um .
@highlight
Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um .
@highlight
This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons .
@highlight
And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on .
@highlight
and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um .
@highlight
As Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption .
@highlight
if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .
@highlight
Um I worried about the materials , uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .
@highlight
and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .
@highlight
I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , Um , did we come in under budget ?
@highlight
to put this into um production , we're looking at about It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .
@highlight
um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?
@highlight
on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .
@highlight
Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with .
@highlight
and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not .
@highlight
And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .
@highlight
Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ?
@highlight
Covers ?
@highlight
or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?
@highlight
we didn't quite have enough material uh .
@highlight
as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .
@highlight
we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .
@highlight
It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way Very cool , nice job .
@highlight
Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice .
@highlight
Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance .
@highlight
Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um .
@highlight
if we can just itemize what's in here , it's a solar cell thing With a back-up battery ?
@highlight
The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , M come in at sixteen ?
@highlight
a bit over budget , um .
@highlight
what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery .
@highlight
Uh I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time and saying oh look my remote isn't working I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .
@highlight
I think unfortunately that's our best option .
@highlight
'Cause we can't remove the push buttons um , nor would changing the case materials .
@highlight
Gotta do what you gotta do .
@highlight
I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .
@highlight
I guess now we just go to the project evaluation basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .
@highlight
Um so I was looking at basic design things , are technologies up to where we hoped they would be Is the design what we wanted it to do ?
@highlight
and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
Does it respond to voice recognition ?
@highlight
Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .
@highlight
but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .
@highlight
So I think overall we're headed in the right direction .
@highlight
They like that spongy feel .
@highlight
I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel I got this slide from the coach this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um .
@highlight
Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and I'm not sure what it's connected to .
@highlight
I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um .
@highlight
As in within the team or ?
@highlight
I think so yeah .
@highlight
Are we considering these points here ?
@highlight
I think they're starting blocks I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in .
@highlight
Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .
@highlight
We didn't use the whiteboard at all .
@highlight
No , no whiteboard .
@highlight
and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .
@highlight
Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything .
@highlight
Was pretty cool tack though .
@highlight
I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach .
@highlight
Attempts to contact coach ineffective .
@highlight
n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .
@highlight
And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .
@highlight
I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .
@highlight
I think the teamwork was good as well .
@highlight
My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .
@highlight
What did you guys think about the the the roles ?
@highlight
I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough .
@highlight
At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .
@highlight
but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all .
@highlight
Nothing , I didn't even get an email , I feel like that was slightly lacking when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot .
@highlight
'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .
@highlight
And I think your leadership was quite good .
@highlight
It was really good yeah .
@highlight
I did get I I felt like I got way too into it .
@highlight
But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ?
@highlight
except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?
@highlight
I think so .
@highlight
No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .
@highlight
is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?
@highlight
I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .
@highlight
and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .
@highlight
I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .
@highlight
it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for .
@highlight
Usually I would do a lot more doodling too I felt like I needed to be professional I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like .
@highlight
is this all we need to get through ?
@highlight
I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .
@highlight
It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?
@highlight
that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file I didn't change this one at all .
@highlight
Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?
@highlight
Uh I think they still do their job .
@highlight
how much can you do with a remote control ?
@highlight
how long was our meeting supposed to be ?
@highlight
I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um .
@highlight
I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing .
@highlight
at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .
@highlight
Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em .
@highlight
My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .
@highlight
An interesting day all in all I would say .
@highlight
It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically .
@highlight
You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept .
@highlight
we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .
@highlight
And it's all recorded , I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like uh I will save this into the project documents .
@highlight
You guys ready to celebrate ?
@highlight
that's our last step .
@highlight
Celebration .
@highlight
I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .
@highlight
I guess we'll call that a a doner .
@highlight
that's the end of the meeting .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Project Update**

ES2005c.json,"No. We should make a big sponge lemon, and then it'd be it would be yellow. It's Yeah. Mm. No, it's got it's got it. Wow. Uh it looks threatening. It looks like yeah. Wow. Then d blind don't watch T_V_. They do? The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh, I think. Ben bana Hmm. But uh price price not withstanding um, is it too complicated, is it gonna be too much just overload? But but the thing is when you use a remote control, you never look at it, right? You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th So which vegetable? Okay. The the lemon. Well what are the options? Oh. Okay. Um so I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among, and I'll I'll give you the uh, I guess, technical considerations for those. And I'm gonna use the whiteboard, just 'cause we haven't used it. Right. So, the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls, see how they work, uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it, and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget. So uh yeah, looking inside a a very simple remote control. Um this is what they sent me. 'Kay. Here's uh the competition, I suppose. Um you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, um and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which um receives input from the buttons, and ch Right, it's very they're very cheap remote. This remote costs nothing, you know. Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, op-amps, and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light, which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end, and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television. Oh here it is. Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control, because it it defines the uh R Um no, I mean this is a very old one, so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make. Right. So this is what we need to have for certain. Um. So you know, as we said, we got the outer casing, which we have to decide, you know, what's it gonna be, um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up, processor, um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had, amplifier and transmitter are all standard. Um so for the casing, uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, whatnot, um latex, double-curved, curved. So lots of choices, what do we think? Uh or sponge, I guess, isn't on there, right. Organic sponge. Uh yeah, it's very elasticy for sure. Um. Yeah so Okay so, here are a a plastic, uh latex Oh right. So something with give to it. Okay. And and the colour is yellow, right? Yellow, okay. Um. Mm' kay. So yellow for the body, and then what colour for the buttons? So multi-coloured buttons. Okay. Okay. Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly? Maybe double What about a banana? Yeah? Okay, like we could have a big banana shaped remote control, 'cause it's yellow fruit, right? Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point, I guess. We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end. So a spongy banana re Yeah. Okay, okay. See So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric. So it'd look like this kinda. Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? Yeah, and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say, you know, it transmits from this end. Yeah. Okay, so double-curved, single-curved, what do we feel? Okay. Okay um, I guess, since you're the marketing guy. We'll uh Okay, we could do that. Um. Okay, so so buttons. Okay, just like that. Okay. With the scroll-wheel or no? Okay uh I could put the microphone here. Okay there's the microphone. Where should I put the microphone? Okay, well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels, right? Okay. Okay. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or 'Kay there's the mic. Um n well we can Whoops. Um. Yeah. Um. Oops, sorry. Okay. Right. Hmm. They can work from a You don't have to hold it. Yeah. I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers, you know they have uh fruits all round them. Now just make sure they don't eat the remote. Yeah. Okay. But yeah But yeah, about the speech thing, it doesn't have to be hand held or close. It can sit at a distance and pick it up still. Yeah yeah. Okay, um so Yeah, s I guess we decided on material, right? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel, and the colours we got down, and the shape, maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Great. Um as for the energy source um, you know, almost every remote control uses just batteries, but we don't have to be limited by that. We can use a hand-dynamo. Um I don't know what that means, we crank it? Right, it's like those watches that you c So, this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab, you can shake it if it's out of power. Okay. So if it if it's not working, I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing. Right. Okay. Uh there's solar power. Um. Yeah. Okay, so probably just Mm. 'Kay. Okay. So uh a rechargeable battery. Okay. Um the user interface, the buttons, I guess we talked about this already. Um. Hmm? Uh th the uh the electronics um, basically the more features we add um Oops, this one. So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in, which adds to the cost as you can expect. Um. But uh I think we can keep it all under budget. So uh yes, so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through. So just in time. Right, right. Yeah, and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out. Huh? Oh yeah that was that was it. So control F_ eight, right? Try uh flipping the screen down. 'Kay. Oh, I get to do it, too. Oh neat. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Save everything to the shared documents, is that right? Oh. Uh these lapel mics are trouble. Are we done with our meeting? Yeah.
Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time. So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens. Um I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time. Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you? N No? Okay, cool. Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj. Alright, okay. Fashion. Mm 'kay. Fruit and veg, well there you go. Just what I think of when I think of a remote control. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Function F_ eight. Hmm. Excuse me. Uh, yeah. Mm 'kay. either. Uh okay. Right, okay. Yeah. Excellent. Uh no just escape should uh 'Kay. Looks pretty complicated. Right, okay. Mm-hmm, like the middle button. Okay. Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right, well, if I s if I'm thinking of the right one, I've got the same thing in front of my monitor, you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require, you press the middle of the scroll. Right, okay. Yeah, presumably. Yeah, looks like uh looks like something out of a jet. Okay. Yeah, I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um, I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing. So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever. Yeah. I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something, is it? Strange. No they do, they do. They listen to it. Yeah. Right, okay. 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway, don't they? Brilliant. That's handy. Okay. Okay. It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty, you know. Okay. Yeah. I can't see tha Although, th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now, so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I I the black and white, I guess, it just doesn't look funky enough. Um but, I mean, like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens, w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them. Twelve fifty. Possibly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well I mean we could make a Yeah. Well, si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours, I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know, we've just made a lemon. Mm-hmm. I like I like the colourful buttons as well. Yeah. I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five, so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use. Yeah. And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker, so 'Kay. Yeah, looks like it. Uh Yeah, I was just thinking the self same thing. Magic man. Mm-hmm. So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip, is it? Right. Okay. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or? They gotta be Almost a key-ring. Okay. 'Kay. Well. Well, I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it, doesn't it. Um Yeah. And that would k also give it kinda durability and and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast. Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? Oh right, okay. I don't know what that stuff is. Yeah. Or at least incorporating, yeah. I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh I don't know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or uh Mm-hmm. Um. Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself. Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. Yeah. Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well. I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use, a bit comfier, you know. Yeah it's uh, yeah, that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold so you don't drop it. Well, yeah, I mean like Yeah, yeah. Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip. Yeah. They only cost pennies. Huh? Um. I mean that that th does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe. S And sponginess. Huh. Uh. Yeah, why the hell not. Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros. Um. Well, I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, yeah? Yeah, we can relate it by advertising or Yeah. There's a good man. There's a good idea. Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions, you know, up and down, uh play, stop. They've got, I mean, they've got standard sort of intuitive um things that are always used. That's cool. I like it. Um. Uh speech recognition, I think, so we need a microphone presumably. Yeah. I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use? Glad, we're not doing this for real. Yeah. And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone I would put it sort of sub-centrally, so it's Yeah. So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it, if it's gonna be voice recognition. Oops. Um. Upsidaisy. I s I still like it. Um but that's me. Yes, or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far. I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes. Um don't wanna sort of overkill. 'Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing? Do we want to go for buttons at all, do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? Yeah, you know, and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly. Um. Yeah. Make them make them think of fruit, yeah. I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh, I dunno, an apple. Then it's just apple so sort of Uh, yellow apples though Hmm. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that's good. Groovy. Yeah,. Yeah. So I mean like you could actually Yeah, gives you the options. So a selection of casings. It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um Like like mobiles, yeah. You can standardise those, I mean. I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons, 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it, 'cause they want to look at it, if they're using it, and what they want to look at is facing away from them. It doesn't really You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it, unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side, and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down. And you've got the facia, and you can just talk at the Maybe. So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so we stick with what we've got there. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Well, it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow. So again I mean like we could have, uh I mean, we could quite easily have the the main body be a different colour, but have kinda going round, yeah. Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour, so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together. So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing. W sort of Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it, it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it. Uh yeah. Yeah, I like that, yeah. Yeah. Okay. You shake it and scream at it. Yeah. It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated. Then if it's just sitting on the Okay, okay. Right um what are the other options? Yeah. I'm I'm with uh Raj on that, I think, you know, I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house, there's not really ever sun coming in my window. Oh that's true. I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a, yeah, having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but um for using it as uh recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition. Yeah that kind of thing. Yeah. Rechargeable.. What's chip on print? What's Sorry, never mind. Yeah, and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping. That's good. Uh woah. Okay, we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing. Um we're kind of running out of time, so if you could Uh. Was that you? Um that was your bit's covered, I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next. Um, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I just touch the pad. It's actually shut down. Okay, um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay. Yeah. It's you guys. Yeah. So um, you know I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape. Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches. Uh yeah, I hope I can recover this, 'cause I've accidentally deleted it. Which doesn't really help me much. Yeah, can you save that uh send that last one again, please, Raj, as I still can't find it on the Okay. No. Okay, thank you. Um yeah, Project, Project Documents. Uh right, that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents. Project Documents is on the um desktop. Really? Oh right, I think um Hold on. Yeah, I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda. S Um presumably there's clay somewhere. Um. Four. Whoops. Light, light, please. Light. Right, there you go. Yeah, quite. And we're using this our basic chip set, so it's all good. Um I think we're almost done, yeah. Oh oops. Sorry man. Uh okay, still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and Uh. Apples. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. 'Kay, so we came up with that, that's okay. What's supplements? Supplements. Uh uh. See. I shoulda something like that. If I kn see I I knew that. I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape. Just for cruelty. I wonder if they mean like literally make it, sort of buttons and everything. Um. Uh no, I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions, 'cause I'm confused. Huh? Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute, it's a There we go. Warning, finish meeting now. I rounded it up far too fast. Um. Where are we going? My Documents, that's not what I want. My Project Documents. There we go.
Mm-hmm. Okay. Cool. Mm um. No, I don't think so. The last one is the most important one, is it? Oh, sorry. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I was just reading fruit and vegetables. Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Th that's very good. Glow-in-the-dark. Okay. Well, that's good. That's what we kind of predicted anyway. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, the spongy, not real spongy, you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff? Okay. Quite disposable. Okay. Oh okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Cool. Mm. A remote control? Yeah. And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey, that they said we don't want? Or was it just Okay. Cool. F_, what is it? Um. yeah. Okay. No signal. Is that? Okay, and then F_ five, right? Okay. Um okay, so the interface concept um. Yeah. The interface specification, what people um how they interact with it basically, I think. Um so the method, we looked at existing designs, what are the what's good about them, what's bad about them, um I looked at their flaws, so we're going to look at their flaws, everything. Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good, so a bit of imagination. Uh the findings, I've got some pictures to show you as well. Yeah. Okay, so most remote controls use graphical interface, where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something. Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout, which makes it confusing. So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls, but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something, I think, people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use. And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you. Do I press Escape F_ five? Or just Escape, okay. Um, oh I still haven't got my glasses on. Yeah, okay. So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones. I'll just walk you through them. This one is a voice recognition. And that's the kind of idea we're going for. There's um an L_C_D_ thing, which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse, which Yeah. Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that, like would the computer come Uh-huh, that's like the L_C_D_ one, is it? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen. I think that's what that is. So these are just a few ideas. Again that's just quite boring shape, grey, looks quite space-agey, but too many buttons, I think on that one. Yeah, it does look kind of dangerous. Um this one I thought was really cool. It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about. You can put it in there, it's for your kids, and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool. And that's really easy to use, bright, so I like this one lot for our design. I think something like that would be good. Of course yellow. Right, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something. And this one, the over-sized one, I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I don't think that will sell very well. I guess so. I don't know. I think that's a bit Yeah exactly. Yeah. And um this one is just pointing out. I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything, but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down, but it would actually go up, because of the shape. So that could that's a bit confusing. Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons. They don't have to be all the same. So that's quite cool. Um. Yeah, exactly. Um F_ five. Yes. So there are some of the findings. So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. Um yeah it is, just in time, very handy. Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. It's you program it like you say, record, um and then, play, and then, record, play machine, and stuff like that, so that's And it's much Yeah. So that's quite cool. Uh personal preferences just some imagination, the raised symbols I thought were good, the L_C_D_, it does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the Yeah. And the speech recognition, 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition, are we? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But our budget, we've Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost,. The L_C_D_. Yeah. No. Yeah. S Uh-huh. Yeah, that's the thing, because Yeah. That's true, yeah. And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use, so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_. It's a it's great, it's a good idea, but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think. Child-friendly, I thought this was good, as you pointed out the um the bit, it often goes missing especially with children, but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape, I think. Yeah, I know, carrot. Yeah. But we don't want it to be Yeah. Um the child-friendly, yeah. Easy to use, it seems quite easy to use. I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff. I think that's a good idea to go for. Yeah. And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea, because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing. Um. Yeah. S yeah. So they'd be able to use that um, as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen. Um so there you go. Yeah. So that's um the user interface design. So okay, I'll take this out now then. There you go. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I'm not sure about the sponge. Yeah. Yeah. I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and Yeah. And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around. Yeah, y yellow incorporated, yeah. I think Mm. Yeah, the buttons w like, 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually, I don Yeah. You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red, and stuff like that, yeah. Makes it easy to use. Yeah, that's true, because that blue one did look quite hardish. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Like uh an hour glass kind of figure, is that what you're thinking of, or just like a It's not Yeah. We could make novelty remote controls. Yeah. But then how would you point it? How would you point it? What Yeah. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. Rubber banana. Okay. Yeah. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. And what else did you say about fashions? What was trendy? And spongy, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, yeah. Like what's what's that, I don't even know the name of it, some kind of, you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing. I don't know the name of that. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah, maybe that's what they are. 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and Yeah. I don't know. What do you guy What do you think? No. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. And buttons would, did we say? Uh different shapes of buttons? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm not sure. Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think. Um yeah, I can no I'm not sure. I couldn Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. So let's not use the whiteboard any more. And uh so what else was there? Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing, the strip around it? Are we just gonna leave that? You still like it. 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system. 'Cause um it could Yeah. Especially with yellow. Mm. I dunno. Then you put it in the fruit bowl? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, do we need buttons? Mm. I quite like the shape. I quite like the design of that, uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base. Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause you said about disposable, didn't you? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that, like have a choice. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We still need the buttons in the same places thought, don't we? Oh, that's the other side. Oh, okay. Oh, half a fruit. Oh, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um because Well, I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing, because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah, w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five, thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said. They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that, because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know. I mean we could make it nice pale yellow. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with, you said, the logan the slogan. Because Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, a d a dynamo? Yeah. Yeah, like with those watches that you kind of twist. Yeah that's quite cool. Yeah, it is, yeah. Yeah, then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah. That's true. But w like just normal light? And we're a very environmentally friendly company, aren't we as well? Yeah. Yeah. Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Just in time. Yeah, mine seems to have turned off. I can't do anything. No. It's on, but there's nothing on the screen. Cool. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. I think, I've saved mine already. Cool. Fun. Yeah. Star fruit. No. Oh yeah, we can do buttons. No I'm good. Okay. Mm.
Yeah. Hi, me Raj, again. Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching, uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this. So we have to look on this. First of all methodology. The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So what are our findings? In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good, rather than having a functional look and feel uh good. So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls. So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor, because this factor is twice as important, the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor. So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls. No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile, the it should have a fancy outlook, the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good, it should have a fancy look and foo feel good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative. We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are. So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition, something like that. So that indicates our technological advancement. And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use, like it shouldn't be too much co complicated, there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control, it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way. And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something. So that they could know how to use these remote controls. When we did uh f fashions uh, recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that Ah yeah? Y yeah uh yeah, we have to, because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes, shoes, and everything with fruits and vegetables, because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic, becoming more and more organic, becoming Yeah. So Yeah. So something like that we we should do. And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look, hard look. Yeah. Yeah. So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it. So that should also be taken into consideration. So these are my views. So No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah. 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also, because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration, so we don't want to have any harm to the society, so So that's all. S uh we didn't find out any such point. Uh yes, there could be, but we couldn't find out any, so Yeah. Oh no,. Yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more, but they want the quality, they want f fancy look, they want some new design, something new. Uh yeah. Yeah. So even if we increase our cost little bit, within uh some limits, and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook, I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market. And the Uh i it will be easy because there will be, on L_C_D_ s screen, there will be different frent icons, they can just click ok okay, whatever they wa Ah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I appreciate this idea, because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables, the people's choices. That what our data shows that, so this w this w Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables, like people uh now Spongy. Yeah, then only we can relate it with something. Yeah. Exactly. Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. Yeah, sure. I will be happy to do that. Yeah. Or we can we can do one thing, we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes, different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece. So whatever people want, like if somebody want it in banana shape, we will put that casing onto that mobile phone, okay, it will look l Uh yeah. In that w S s sorry? Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of, we need not to have a full cover, we will just have a half of cover, okay? If somebody wants it i in banana shape, we will fit banana shape casing onto that, so it will give a banana shape look. If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that, we will put we will put apple shape casing on that. It will give apple shape look. So in that way you can have any, that means whatever you want, without uh yeah. Yeah, button will be on the upper side, buttons will be the on the upper side. Yeah, buttons will be on the upper side, lower side we will just put the casing, so half of that will be look the Yeah, not not the upper side. So from lower you can, it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look, whatever. So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything, we will just design casings fruit shape. And Yeah,. But But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo, tha these type of cells? Because then people have to, well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah, to mo Yeah. Yeah, because most of the people Yeah. Uh, solar power will w also not be a good idea, because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy, and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah. Yeah. What we w yeah. I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. They can they can recharge it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Uh excuse me, Bri You just touch the pad, yeah. No? That's great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh it was under a different name. I will show you, in shared documents. Uh working components. Oh, you didn't get that. I will send new. Uh I'll put it in shared documents, again. Project documents, sorry, I put it in the shared documents. Uh yeah. Right, that's great. But I cou can't open that, because it w asks uh for some username or password. I'll show you. Ts Sorry. Uh. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, th thank you. Oh sorry. Uh excuse me, Brian. You have to keep your pen separate, because I used your pen. S Hmm. Hmm. So sh should Should we leave now, Brian? Or we are going to discuss something? Yeah. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. So.
@highlight
mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time .
@highlight
Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good .
@highlight
The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative .
@highlight
And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something .
@highlight
When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look .
@highlight
Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?
@highlight
The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co okay , so the interface concept um .
@highlight
Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .
@highlight
but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you .
@highlight
There's um an L_C_D_ thing , I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .
@highlight
This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side .
@highlight
But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .
@highlight
Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .
@highlight
Um this one I thought was really cool .
@highlight
It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about .
@highlight
and it's quite an organic shape Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .
@highlight
So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .
@highlight
And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky .
@highlight
I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .
@highlight
I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good .
@highlight
you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .
@highlight
I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , .
@highlight
Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ .
@highlight
It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think .
@highlight
we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .
@highlight
Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s I like I like the colourful buttons as well .
@highlight
I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff .
@highlight
And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , Child-friendly , I thought this was good , I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those .
@highlight
And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it .
@highlight
the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , Um .
@highlight
So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved .
@highlight
Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , And that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast .
@highlight
so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?
@highlight
I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours So multi-coloured buttons .
@highlight
or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .
@highlight
Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well .
@highlight
I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , Like uh an hour glass kind of figure , Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip .
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
How would you point it ?
@highlight
We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end .
@highlight
y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea .
@highlight
it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe .
@highlight
I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape .
@highlight
So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?
@highlight
you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .
@highlight
There's a good man .
@highlight
There's a good idea .
@highlight
Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?
@highlight
uh I could put the microphone here .
@highlight
Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?
@highlight
Uh speech recognition , I think , So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?
@highlight
I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ?
@highlight
do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ?
@highlight
l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .
@highlight
But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .
@highlight
we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .
@highlight
button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .
@highlight
So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .
@highlight
s I guess we decided on material , So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know .
@highlight
So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .
@highlight
Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , We can use a hand-dynamo .
@highlight
So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .
@highlight
But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?
@highlight
It does leave them with an obligation to Uh there's solar power .
@highlight
Um .
@highlight
Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea .
@highlight
so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .
@highlight
having a rechargeable stand , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping .
@highlight
I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next .
@highlight
and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay .
@highlight
uh our next meeting's in half an hour Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .
@highlight
Okay .
@highlight
Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ?
@highlight
You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen .
@highlight
I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything .
@highlight
Or we are going to discuss something ?
@highlight
Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , There we go .

IS1007d.json,"So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control. So. So let's see the what did you prepare. Sh share folder for th your presentation? Because I have here Okay just one. Why you why you you put it in the the side? It's not a good place maybe. Oh it's very costly, microphone array. How much does it cost this one? Fifteen dollars? Ah it's above it's above the budget. How many b battery is there? Battery. So one one battery? It's kinetic reserve. Mm. I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed. If you Mm-hmm. No four dollars, it's good. And we will we will serve the charger with this? With the remote control. Okay so the price of the charger included in the Mm-hmm. The price should be below twelve and a half Euro. Well that's so We have we have just The price of selling is twenty five Euros. And the price of production That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more. Yeah. Okay. But Mm-hmm. Titanium. What what's Maybe yeah. What's the price to p to produce? With with with the charge? Okay. We don't have charger. We don't have all the options. Charger we don't have charger here either. No it's it's below the the the budget. It's below the bu the budget. We Yeah. You. And you? Mm-hmm. Uh For L_C_D_. Without L_C_D_. Uh no innovative yeah. So let's remove it. But This is the problem. No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_. Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price, and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Without L_C_D_. Yeah. What a what what about the sys speech recognition? what about the integration of speech recognition? Ah so it's optional with the okay. I think it will be I think i I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control, because maybe parents will lose these uh Yeah. Or ma yeah. Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or, so mayb better if you have all this in the same Yeah. So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional. Uh I think it inc increase. I think it i increases. Hmm. And and we we we we we we don't want that. So Project evaluation project satisfaction, for example. I don't know, we have to ask these question. We have to give answers so Project evaluation. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think so. He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants. Uh the teamwork was very very good. I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you. Oh. Less fancy. De Without without L_C_D_, without speech recognition, it will be simple. Yeah free free coffee. Yeah thank you for your work and
Okay. Yeah, so can you go out to the shared folder? Mm the shared folder. Yes. We have a presentation. Uh So I got the participant uh three. W uh. Three. It's the final design, yeah. S so so I discussed with Guillaume. Right. And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes, because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive. So we come up with two versions. One with and one without L_C_D_s. Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module. And detachable big buttons for all people um. So. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it. The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere. Yeah Mm. Yeah yeah. For the Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it. A_A_ rechargeable batteries. Yeah rechargeable batteries. We have the charger so it's no problem. Actually uh it's a flexible thing. You just n uh Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. At uh yeah. I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there, b this button yeah alright. This button is like the mouse is like a joystick, you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button. You can move up, down, left, right, or you can do a swing. So a swing to the left, a swing to the right defines other functions. So even though it's a single button, but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement. Yeah. This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_. Here I present another version without the L_C_D_. Mm. Uh okay this is new prototype uh. Yeah yeah. Mm. Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our Yeah. W w I'll I'll come to that point later on. Yeah. Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah. Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh. It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types. I think we have to investigate more on that, but Yeah. Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says, people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah we'll we'll come up to that, the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more. If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system, so is uh modular. Yeah yeah, for example the L_C_D_, you can take it you can put it put it back in, or you can use the other one, or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah. You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see. So It's pretty flexible in the yeah price. Uh yeah yeah you should present that. Yeah. Yeah Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful. Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons, powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities. But in addition with simplicity. So that's the best idea, the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here. Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you. The first one is the speech recogniser, again it's detachable or add-on. And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust, it doesn't break and the material, what's the material again? Titanium material. Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one, again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want. Lithium-ion may be a good one, but you can replace it with cheaper one, again you pay for what you get, and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder. So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_, uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger, so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part. Yeah and um And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary, so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry? And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre, and this can be used by the adult or by the children. So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night. So it's pretty powerful, and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced, because of this feature. Yeah. And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah. And also like the and the fancy designs yeah. Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Spongy spongy. Mm mm. Mm mm. But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling? We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy. Spongy. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users? Yeah. But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party? Mm. Mm. Mm. I think we can improve on the design. Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design. Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect, functional aspect, but also the simplicity. As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content, because uh that is really innovative, and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity, few buttons, we've uh A lot of functionalities. So that is uh that is uh for both th Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them. Yeah. Uh the innovation is v is very high I think. Both. For both. It's the same innovation. So maybe I can put six to seven. Both. Mm. Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_? We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah but Yes exactly. But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_. Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_, we give what the customer uh wants, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. S Yeah. I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect. I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people. For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons. For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity, so that's why we have the parental module. Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it, but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people. So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable. User customisation is very important yeah. Yeah so W uh I think it's the same. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. To improve on the design. Huh? The speech recogniser is a add-on module. Right? Yeah. Oh. The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component, and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people, and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them. So we might lose the customer because of this. I don't know, what do you think uh? Yes exa what do you think, I don't know. You are Marketing Manag. Yeah. Yeah. But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost? Mm. Mm. Yeah. Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer, because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons. So so Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future. So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer, attracting them to come back in again and again. We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded, it would be a good thing right? Yeah, it depends on the v production. Mm. Mm. Yeah. What we can change is to propose the customers with skins. For example the i the mobile phones nowaday, they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh? Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing. I suppose that you this criteria, is it? Room for creativity. This room is a bit small, but but I think it's okay for us to work with. Yeah mm. Mm. Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay. Good job good job. Thank you. Alright. Mm. Mm we I I know something, we need more cakes, more biscuits on the table while we have meetings. Mm. Mm. Alright then, we finished? Thank you very much.
Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. The cost would be le reduced. Is that two or one? Now what is the whole day rating for that? Whole day's rating. What type of battery? Something like a two A_, A_ three size batteries? Mm-hmm. And the L_C_D_ is this one, on the remote? Yeah. Uh-huh and also the switch. Okay. Mm-hmm. And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger, because that's a major that's a Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then? Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. Okay. Yeah people are willing to pay more, but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment. Or uh Something like customised. Yeah. Mm hmm hmm hmm. Hmm okay. And this is other one? Mm hmm hmm hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's fine. Okay. Mm hmm hmm hmm. With the charger? I think we can use Excel. Yeah it's a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands. I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements, and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentation then. We can wind up. Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions. So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings, and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_, without L_C_D_, with speech recognition interface, or without speech recognition interface, but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is, they want to have an fancy look and feel, it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold. And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative. Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative. And the third one is easy to use. Okay and if we go to the next slide, here you can find these are the latest fashion updates, and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable, so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable, or whatever they like. So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes. And the second thing is, and if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium, it should be somewhat spongy. Um. Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias. One is fancy look, second is innovative, and third is easy to use. So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote. So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these, say that we have a seven point scale, from one to seven, and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this. So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_, so on this scale, if it is true, if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one, or if it is false, it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy, then you could just tell me seven. So We can make our study on this and No no we have you have designed two products now, one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_. According to you, no according to you designers, how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_? Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_. On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control. How do you look how does it look? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy? And you both agree for that? So I take three on with L_C_D_? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it? Four. And in the sense of innovativeness, with L_C_D_. Five with L_C_D_ and So without L_C_D_? No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness? With L_C_D_. And without L_C_D_? Okay. No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts. So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness. So we can't go I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design No it's like this, I mean on the L_C_D_, according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here, and you have L_C_D_, you just press your joystick, you get here a programme. Uh then No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now. L_C_D_? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_. Or then again you have a channels, volume and all the stuff and what a I mean that depends upon your design, so I mean So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness? And which do you recommend e easy to use, with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_? Yeah. Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates. So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition. Even then our product is going to be very good. Yeah. Yeah that's right. Yeah yeah that's right. So without L_C_D_ I just take it five? Or you want it to be six? S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also, and it's going to be much simpler to use. So. That's going to be an optional. If somebody wants to buy it they can have it, otherwise no. It's an optional. Yeah. Yeah, but I mean if you have an add-ons, the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it. In the same set, yeah, and and individual buttons to make them work. I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television. So based on that I think But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options. On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah. Yeah that's right. I mean you could just provide with an optional. So it's something like a Microsoft product update. Updates and we sell it. We make updates and sell it. And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all, but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all. Yeah, yeah that's right. Yeah that's right. I think you need to look into the material. Yeah yeah. I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models. I feel it's fine, we know we don't need uh I think it's okay. This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations. And the leadership was excellent. Yeah that's right. Yeah that's right. And new ideas found. Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting? I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting? Yeah that is within the budget. And the evaluation was Yeah that's right. And the next is celebration. So Yeah thank you, thank you very much.
Mm. Yeah. S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes. Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display. You you can s here. And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button. You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function. You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here. And here the the switch that control if you want Well I I I think uh it's the Yeah but Yeah. Well so it's a microphone array. No it's just a single microphone, and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here, for instance. And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off. And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger. Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars, but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah, but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila. Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars. How many, excuse me? Well uh f battery, we use uh about uh Yeah. Rechargeable of course, because we have the charger. Yeah and you just On uh yeah one battery. The excuse me? Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist. Yeah. So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone, it's alright. Then the next time you pick it, oh it works. Yeah just explain the button uh Norman. Yep. Yeah it's So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration. The second version is also simpler, we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also. So basically th it's the same uh yeah. Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before. But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation. Press one button uh acting as a a enter button. So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user. And uh it's also cheaper to produce. We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars. Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system. So so Norman will explain to you. Yeah yeah of course mm. Thank thank you. And so mm-hmm. Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features. You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do, and uh which channel you want to choose and so on. H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_, up they come up with their modules, they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here. We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons, clearly labelled, and it acts like the previous one, you just plug in and it works. The titanium and so it's very uh Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one, say we start from four dollars to produce such a device. Uh it's about it The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems. Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules, and finally three dollars for the charger. So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_, which costs two dollar, you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two. It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars. But it's just if you want all functionalities. Excuse me? Yeah. Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons. Okay. A sponge. Hmm. Yeah. Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four. Yeah. It's it it Technical aspects. Yeah a three. Uh four. I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look. Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five, six. Well five also uh Norman please. With lot of functionalities. Mm for both it's the the same innovations. six, let's go for six. Yeah. Talk about Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen. If you have the L_C_D_, but if n Yeah. Yeah. Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons, and uh well t p the menu are clear, well-organised, so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use. Yeah, it's cheaper to produce. And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so Yep. Yeah. Six. Um six. Yes as you say, with better uh yeah. And to improve the the look. Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so so let's go back to our laboratory and Yeah. It's optional yeah, since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than Yeah. Well it's about the same because if Well you can if you had uh something li Oh no, because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module, but uh Yeah. Yeah. Well so Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that. Sponge. Okay. So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say. That was good. Yeah. Fine yes uh. Very democratic. Thank you. Alright. Come up with new product. Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that, but I think it's alright. We achieved uh project goal I think. It's w yes, more or less. Yeah but Alright. So. So uh coffee machine. Okay.
@highlight
So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control .
@highlight
So let's see the what did you prepare .
@highlight
S so so I discussed with Guillaume .
@highlight
and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive .
@highlight
One with and one without L_C_D_s .
@highlight
Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module .
@highlight
And detachable big buttons for all people um .
@highlight
Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display .
@highlight
S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes .
@highlight
And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .
@highlight
You can uh choose the direction You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here .
@highlight
And here the the switch that control if you want The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .
@highlight
Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
@highlight
Well so it's a microphone array .
@highlight
Oh it's very costly , microphone array .
@highlight
it's just a single microphone , I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .
@highlight
And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off .
@highlight
And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .
@highlight
How much does it cost this one ?
@highlight
Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars Ah it's above it's above the budget .
@highlight
but uh it's just a prototype the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .
@highlight
How many b battery is there ?
@highlight
Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it .
@highlight
A_A_ rechargeable batteries .
@highlight
Is that two or one ?
@highlight
Actually uh it's a flexible thing .
@highlight
So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright .
@highlight
I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button .
@highlight
You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing .
@highlight
Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .
@highlight
So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration .
@highlight
The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also .
@highlight
Uh-huh and also the switch .
@highlight
Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before .
@highlight
But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation .
@highlight
Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .
@highlight
So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .
@highlight
And uh it's also cheaper to produce .
@highlight
We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars .
@highlight
And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
@highlight
W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .
@highlight
in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .
@highlight
It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types .
@highlight
I think we have to investigate more on that , but The price should be below twelve and a half Euro .
@highlight
but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .
@highlight
but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .
@highlight
The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
@highlight
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , Something like customised .
@highlight
Yeah for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .
@highlight
You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see .
@highlight
It's pretty flexible in the yeah price .
@highlight
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .
@highlight
H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .
@highlight
the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .
@highlight
Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here .
@highlight
Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you .
@highlight
The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on .
@highlight
And then we also have security feature it's very robust , and the material , what's the material again ?
@highlight
The titanium Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .
@highlight
Lithium-ion may be a good one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder .
@highlight
So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .
@highlight
What's the price to p to produce ?
@highlight
Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .
@highlight
The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .
@highlight
Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger .
@highlight
So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .
@highlight
We don't have all the options .
@highlight
so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .
@highlight
so you want more function you pay more .
@highlight
it's below the the the budget .
@highlight
I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold .
@highlight
And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .
@highlight
Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative .
@highlight
And the third one is easy to use .
@highlight
since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .
@highlight
Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .
@highlight
So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .
@highlight
And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .
@highlight
you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy .
@highlight
Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias .
@highlight
One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .
@highlight
So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .
@highlight
so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .
@highlight
But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?
@highlight
according to you designers , On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control .
@highlight
How do you look how does it look ?
@highlight
D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?
@highlight
I'll I'll say three or four .
@highlight
I think we can improve on the design .
@highlight
Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design .
@highlight
Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .
@highlight
So I take three on with L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?
@highlight
Uh four .
@highlight
I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
@highlight
And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .
@highlight
Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six .
@highlight
from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh A lot of functionalities .
@highlight
So without L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
Mm for both it's the the same innovations .
@highlight
So maybe I can put six to seven .
@highlight
actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts .
@highlight
then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .
@highlight
Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?
@highlight
but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .
@highlight
We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .
@highlight
on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .
@highlight
If you have the L_C_D_ , Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ .
@highlight
But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .
@highlight
Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
@highlight
Well I think both are really easy to use and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so so I will give a six for the easy to use .
@highlight
No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .
@highlight
Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition .
@highlight
I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect .
@highlight
I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people .
@highlight
For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons .
@highlight
For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people .
@highlight
So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?
@highlight
Um six .
@highlight
and it's going to be much simpler to use .
@highlight
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design .
@highlight
what about the integration of speech recognition ?
@highlight
The speech recogniser is a add-on module .
@highlight
That's going to be an optional .
@highlight
S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .
@highlight
As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them .
@highlight
So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional .
@highlight
But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?
@highlight
I think it inc increase .
@highlight
because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .
@highlight
i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future .
@highlight
attracting them to come back in again and again .
@highlight
Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?
@highlight
And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ?
@highlight
Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
@highlight
but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .
@highlight
What we can change is to propose the customers with skins .
@highlight
For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .
@highlight
we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .
@highlight
I think you need to look into the material .
@highlight
I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .
@highlight
Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example .
@highlight
I don't know , we have to ask these question .
@highlight
Room for creativity .
@highlight
This room is a bit small , but but I think it's okay for us to work with .
@highlight
This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .
@highlight
And the leadership was excellent .
@highlight
Yeah I think so .
@highlight
Uh the teamwork was very very good .

And new ideas found .
@highlight
Come up with new product .
@highlight
Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , We achieved uh project goal I think .
@highlight
that is within the budget .
@highlight
yes , more or less .
@highlight
Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple .

ES2004d.json,"Is that for us? Okay. Yeah, shall I show? I'll show. Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. Can I just nick your Whoa. Going a bit crazy over here. Thank you. Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, the final our final presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there. Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached, but we can we can come up with that. Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. Yeah, yeah. And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit of Yeah. Yeah. Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. And then yeah. It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something. It'll just shout out I'm here, or something to similar effect. Uh yeah, if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time, maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. Um the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer, just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on. Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, on the front on the front side of that, yeah. So when you've actually got it open, it would be facing the T_V_. And then finally um on to the interface. The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it, uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off, and uh things to that effect. And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. No d not not actually. No, not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing. And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics, as that is that's the company logo. There you go.. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah, two or three. No, three. Three. Mm yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'd give it a one. No, no, not at all. Yeah. Two. Two. Yeah. D_. One. Yeah. Yeah, that's No, no, the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue, but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised. Yeah, yeah, yeah and No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. Yeah, I'll give it a one as well. Yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It's meant to be. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually, 'cause Yep. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible. Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud. So it would be s p yeah. Yeah. Yeah, one. I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product, but W I thin yeah, I think yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It was a regular chip on print and Oh, no, no, no, the um Yeah, it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. In the top, it's the number of c yeah. Yeah, and yeah, just a no, one reg v uh Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. And they're double curved. No. Y Two, 'cause it's two. Yeah, I'd say I'd say it was w yeah, I think I think it's One double-curved. And one no, 'cause one yeah, one's double-curved, and then the other one's a plastic. Yeah. And special colour. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, that's it's as an extra. So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get. Yeah, okay. Yeah, the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. And buttons Well yes. Yeah. No, we'll have No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again. C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine, because the exchange range would make it about twelve. No. Yeah, the standard, it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah. If if you take away the voice, I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. Yeah i yeah. No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. They n n yeah, but you p minus three plus two. Yeah. But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. Yeah. We c we could s Yeah, we could say Yeah, I s And then say we recommend Yeah. Yeah. That'll do it. Twelve point three five. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? Ah. Okay. Yeah. No. 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra, you could just take that out and that would be fine, yeah. Yeah, I think that's brilliant. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'd say, as a team. Yeah. Find out from each other, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, I thought it it went really well and I yeah, I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out, although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, but yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, well. Discuss which ones yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more, had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Vegetables. Yeah. No. Yeah, I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player, does anyone remember the remote control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah, just jazz it up a bit. Uh d they don't really think about it, because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player, the video player, the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well. I think that was just the the physical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I don't from the market research. No. Yeah, it was I it's top secret. Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here. That's what it is. In your yeah. Okay. Is that it then? Awesome. Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing? I don't think. Yeah, the the s yeah. I think yeah, questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting. Mm.
Is that someone's? Okay. Or something. Well done. Certainly. Logged in? Thank you. Oops. Okay. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up, and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Does that seem clear? Any questions there? So we're going to look at these crite Yes, we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. Is that okay? One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that? Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. I'll just go this way. Two. Okay. Two. A four, okay. Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right. Two and three quarters? Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer. The average oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying? Okay. So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay, and we're just waiting for your rating f Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay. So what are you rating for this one, Paw? Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two, nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true. Two. A two, okay. Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I? We'll just put almost two, because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places. Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use? Right. So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do. Okay. And the spongy feel is no problem with that. Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Yep. Everybody? Okay. That part was nice and easy. Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury. I don't think we've really touched on that a lot. We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four. A five, okay. Four and a four okay. Twenty one is that twenty one? So that's four point two five. And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that? It was the I'm here thing, yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or. Right. Okay. You built into the feature. Okay. Logical. That's a one for me. One and one, good. So, how do we feel about this? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? We happy to go ahead? Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that. I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up? Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there. Oops. Oh yes. Yes. But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit. So it can rest. It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. Mm. The other curves at the sides, but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over. Yeah. What does it mean if you put point five for that? Mm-hmm. Right, okay. But it is gonna be part of the total cost, and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in, is there? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Okay. Mm. Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference? Is it oh, it's brought it slightly down. So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? Oh, it's not made any difference, has it?. It's gone up again. Oh. It's brought it down slightly. Is there anything on the menu No. If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? And people are used to buying batteries, they're not gonna say I'm not getting this, 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control. Should we see what difference it makes? Um Yeah. Sure. But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. But we need to work to that specification to start with. And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so Mm. Yeah. 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it. Yeah. So if we take voice recognition out we are. Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your words there. Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro? Which is less than ten P_. That's today's kick off meeting,. Mm. I thought that's what it was. So we're okay. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. And I've certainly felt heard, listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah. Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line. And fake R_C_s. How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information? Could it've been better, was it adequate? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It's really borrowing from other areas, it's, you know, bringing things from other areas in, it so it's I mean nothing is new, but it's applying it to a d in a different area. Absolutely, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the focus isn't on to that, yeah. I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with, and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake, and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based. Yeah. But forcing it onto people, yeah. It's things that, you know, they might want to buy the thing they really want. Mm. Mm. Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever, yeah. See I think I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone. Mm-hmm. But I think in the remit that we were given, it was very specific. I think we've done what we were required to do, and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things. I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for. I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want. I know. Maybe it will. Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it. Mm-hmm. Questionnaire. Questionnaire done. Oh, I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time. Oh, right. But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too? Yeah.
If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time. Is that. three, apparently. Okay, you all switched on. I presume we're good to go. Okay, um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, um 'cause it can come in various different sizes, it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor. We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_. Okay? Prototype presentation. I think that would be you. Make sure the camera's Yes, yes you can. Wait a second, I'll get it out. Um Okay. You should have one of those things and you can just take it off. Ta-da. Right. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. So it's flush. Oh right, okay, yeah. So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, 'cause it's the top part that's okay. Okay. I'm under the sofa. Or, that would be too complicated. Infrared. Like here. Okay. Actually, no, it would be it would have to be on the on the front. Oh right, yeah, okay, yeah, I've got you. It's still pointing, yes. Yeah, that would make sense. Okay. But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's Okay. Thank you very much. Wrapping it all up, okay. Um I've now got evaluation criteria. It's to be presented. Okay. It's quite similar to what it was before, though. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Okay. Just write small. Yeah. That works. Mm-hmm. I would agree. Okay. I would say two. A two. It's just two point five for that one. I would say a two. I would say a two. One point seven f five. Okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One. Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to. Um maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much. So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between. It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um Four. A standard. It would be. And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room. One. I don't think so. I think we yeah. I think we're set. Do much apart from having a huge big Don't think so. Okay, thank you. Okay, I've got finance here now. I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it, if that's okay. Um. Thanks. Right. Now I presume that the screen will go blank, that um Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Okay. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. Right, what's happening with the electronics? Double-curved. Oh, right, okay. Thanks. So, would there be two? One chip. Okay. One double curve. So what's a single curve then? So just one double Yeah. Um Mm. Um we've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?. Um Do you think? Okay. It would be like saying we're using See, it says case material. So we're not actually using plastic in the case, are we? It's including, it's including. Okay, we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half. Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. No, we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay, special colour, do we need that? N yeah, okay. Interface. Buttons Has that not gone up? Oh no, it was seven five it's changed not a lot. Oh, it's not calculated it. Okay, there we go. It's not a lot though. We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface. Where's the where's the voice recognition? Right, okay. Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three. Oh, right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way, we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. You could choose to have that or not. So should we just change the design specification then? Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, we can make the price fit, and then say if we'd had our budget, we would've had this, because it also sets it apart from the crowd. They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different. It's s something completely different associated with your company. Right, okay, so It's two point five. No, it's twelve point two five. Yeah well two, twelve point two five times two is twenty five, isn't it? I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? No. Twelve point five. Well done, people. So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place? Okay. Okay. Right, so we've done that. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, haven't we? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. um in the sense that um did you feel like a team? Or did you feel like uh autonomy? Mm-hmm. Thank you. How did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you know, y it didn't matter it saying what you thought, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant, then it didn't matter, 'cause it was just another idea in the field. I like that. Um teamwork. Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model. Um uh I'm still not caught up. But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Um Maybe. No, that was quite fun. Um means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas? Had time to kind of Yeah, 'cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it, yeah. But it was nice having it there. Um like the whole picture of the thing. Yeah, I think it's new ideas in general, rather than Mm. Yeah, no. Well they have to come from somewhere, don't they? And as sh as w sorry, you go. Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly. I mean they're slightly different, so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's, 'cause it's w something we should think about, but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it. Mm. But then when it everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go, I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you, I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic, you would pray you would pay a lot extra, because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you. But people could have anything that they wanted. Because of the produ Mm. Yes. Yeah. Well, it's innovation for money's sake. The the people have to keep buying. Yeah. And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone, because the phones have moved on, things like that. Yes. It's madness. Um In closing There we go. Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, but I think I don't know, d what do you think? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit, you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that. So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at. But I think but you were saying that that's quite Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It's a shame it won't ever get made. Maybe it will. Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it. Um the project has been evaluated well and truly. Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. Oh, so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with, so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor, so good luck. I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds. Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks. Oh. Um yeah, just the last, I think. I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy. I just got con
Hmm. Thank you. Hmm. Hmm. Yep, me too. Mm-hmm. Yep. Me and William worked on a prototype, and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. Yeah. I can hold it like Yeah, so It looks crazy. Um not now. Oh. Yeah. Oh, where are the hinges? 'Kay. You able to look? Yep.. The black and white touch screen wherein people can Right. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Ah oka Infrared could be here also. Yeah, here.. So when it's even if it's open here, the signals would go. Yeah. This one right here.. Which is No. Look up to it. Yay. So this is the one. Sorry. Evaluation.. Mm um I I think this is chip. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah, it's perfect. Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market okay. 'Kay. Yeah, so you can 'Kay. I would say four. Mm-hmm. Almost three. I think yeah. Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first. Yeah, I I just it the other way. Uh in Yep, I just got two point f One is a, seven is false, okay. Two. Two. White. With for the plastic? Uh blue. Any Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case. One. Mm. Four. Voice r recognition. Hmm. You want me to b unplug that? That's all. Yes. Okay. Chip on print. Okay. Yep. Single-curved. Two curves, yeah. Single-cu. Plastic and rubber. Yeah. Plastic one and maybe rubber point five. No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put point five. Yeah, because there are I think it allows the point five, yeah. We can use that. It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic. Push-button. One. An One. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. Uncurved, flat. No, it just surprises one.. I don't think so. Ri I think it's in Euro. And going to a regular bat Yeah. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. It's internal, nobody looks into the battery. But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form? Mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Make it costly. Yeah we are close to the budget. Two five. It's twelve point five maybe, then. I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be I think it is the first one. So we are under the budget. Seems fine. Except voice recognition, everything is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think we had a nice time. Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. Yeah, and uh Yeah, I think. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. Yeah. I think that was the best part of the 'Kay. Yeah, moving around the room. But I think it's good, like uh we spent times individually. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. That's mine. Yeah, it's The thing is Yep, sorry, go on Sarah. Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones, like a real want to see a new launch or something like that. And new f television products coming up, but nobody giving uh much idea to this. Like Sarah was telling, everything's Right. Mm-hmm. Maybe fifty percent more. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. There's a final questionnaire. Celebration, you didn't talk about that. Yeah.
@highlight
um we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , We wanted a stand-by function .
@highlight
The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .
@highlight
Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design .
@highlight
Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
@highlight
Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
@highlight
Prototype presentation .
@highlight
Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ .
@highlight
Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .
@highlight
I can hold it like and I'll I'll show you the presentation .
@highlight
And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there .
@highlight
Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .
@highlight
This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top The black and white touch screen and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat .
@highlight
we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap .
@highlight
So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .
@highlight
Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .
@highlight
obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .
@highlight
And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .
@highlight
And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .
@highlight
And then finally um on to the interface .
@highlight
The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .
@highlight
And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
@highlight
But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo .
@highlight
Um I've now got evaluation criteria .
@highlight
This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
@highlight
the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .
@highlight
are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?
@highlight
So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
@highlight
The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
@highlight
and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .
@highlight
Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .
@highlight
I won't write all of that out again .
@highlight
It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .
@highlight
So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .
@highlight
Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel .
@highlight
My own rating for that would be a two .
@highlight
Two and three quarters ?
@highlight
criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative .
@highlight
I would give that a three .
@highlight
I'd give it a one .
@highlight
It's just two point five for that one .
@highlight
ease of use .
@highlight
Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .
@highlight
I would say a two .
@highlight
I would say a two .
@highlight
One point seven f five .
@highlight
it incorporates current fashion trends , I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
@highlight
Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
@highlight
the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .
@highlight
So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .
@highlight
'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , In that case it's got to be a one for me .
@highlight
Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .
@highlight
to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
@highlight
I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .
@highlight
we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
@highlight
but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
@highlight
the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .
@highlight
I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
@highlight
I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , And finally , last but not least , easy to locate .
@highlight
Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
@highlight
And are we happy with the costs on that ?
@highlight
That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .
@highlight
Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible .
@highlight
And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .
@highlight
it would be quite loud .
@highlight
That's a one for me .
@highlight
I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there .
@highlight
That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .
@highlight
The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .
@highlight
Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
@highlight
I don't think so .
@highlight
We happy to go ahead ?
@highlight
I think we yeah .
@highlight
I think we're set .
@highlight
I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , I'll just leave it there .
@highlight
I've got finance here now .
@highlight
We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value .
@highlight
So are we still on for kinetic ?
@highlight
Yeah .
@highlight
See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .
@highlight
Um it might have influenced our choice .
@highlight
It was a regular chip on print you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one .
@highlight
one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .
@highlight
One double curve .
@highlight
'cause it's two .
@highlight
what's a single curve then ?
@highlight
It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .
@highlight
like a domed thing .
@highlight
Um we've got plastic and rubber , I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , See , it says case material .
@highlight
we're not actually using plastic in the case , There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing .
@highlight
So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
@highlight
Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .
@highlight
special colour , do we need that ?
@highlight
Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
@highlight
the push-button's one and L_C_ display one .
@highlight
I think we could change the battery also .
@highlight
Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
@highlight
and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
@highlight
and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?
@highlight
so the highest we've got is the electronics here .
@highlight
Um and the interface .
@highlight
If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
@highlight
it um it would make one difference .
@highlight
What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery .
@highlight
but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .
@highlight
If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .
@highlight
If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three .
@highlight
We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .
@highlight
I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
@highlight
We can put in our recommendations .
@highlight
If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .
@highlight
Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers So if we take voice recognition out That'll do it .
@highlight
Twelve point three five .
@highlight
Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
@highlight
we are close to the budget .
@highlight
So we are under the budget .
@highlight
Product evaluation .
@highlight
We've done room for creativity , Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make .
@highlight
Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
@highlight
Although we had our separate tasks , I think we had a nice time .
@highlight
there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other .
@highlight
in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .
@highlight
Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody .
@highlight
We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .
@highlight
And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .
@highlight
I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good .
@highlight
I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .
@highlight
Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ?
@highlight
Any ideas ?
@highlight
How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?
@highlight
Could it've been better , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more .
@highlight
I think it's new ideas in general , It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .
@highlight
but nobody giving uh much idea to this .
@highlight
I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .
@highlight
We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .
@highlight
There are innovations in that that people don't really want .
@highlight
and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based .
@highlight
Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ?
@highlight
And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
@highlight
I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .
@highlight
I think we've done very well to get within budget Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .
@highlight
There's a final questionnaire .
@highlight
we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .","**Meeting Agenda: Remote Control Design Project Update**
